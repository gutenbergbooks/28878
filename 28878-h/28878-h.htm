<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE HOUSE THAT BOBBY BUILT</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s make a bay window for the front,&#8221;
suggested Bobby, dragging up a rocking-chair
and tumbling his younger brother, Twaddles,
out of the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you make a bay window?&#8221; demanded
Twaddles, whom no amount of pushing
out of the way could subdue for long; he simply
came in again.</p>
<p>&#8220;This way,&#8221; said Bobby.</p>
<p>He tipped the rocking-chair over on its side
and turned the curved back so that it fenced in
a space between two straight chairs. Looking
through the carved rounds, if you had a very
good imagination, it really did seem something
like a bay window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, see?&#8221; said Bobby, proud as an architect
should be.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But every house has a chimney,&#8221; protested
Twaddles. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the chimney?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Bobby could possibly invent a chimney,
Meg and Dot, the two boys&#8217; sisters, came
into the room, each carrying a doll.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till Norah sees you!&#8221; announced Meg
severely. &#8220;My goodness, piling up the furniture
like this! Mother will scold if you scratch
that rocking-chair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you making?&#8221; asked Dot, her dark
eyes beginning to dance. &#8220;Let me help, Bobby?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby sat down gloomily on the edge of the
rocking-chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was building a house,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;Mother said we could &#8217;muse ourselves quietly
in the house. This is quiet, isn&#8217;t it? What&#8217;s the
use of having furniture if a fellow can&#8217;t make
something with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I s&#8217;pose if you put it all back before
supper, it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; admitted Meg, rather
dubiously. &#8220;Only you know sometimes you do
scratch things, Bobby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby waived this aside. He had other, more
important thoughts.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was just going to fix the chimney,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;See, this is the door, Meg, an&#8217; over
here&#8217;s the bay window. But we have to have
people. People always live in houses. Don&#8217;t
you want to put Geraldine and what&#8217;s-her-name
in &#8217;fore I put the chimney on?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot, who was the doll Geraldine&#8217;s mother,
clutched her closely, while Meg quickly picked
up her doll from the couch where she had laid
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;There won&#8217;t anything hurt &#8217;em,&#8221; protested
Bobby earnestly. &#8220;Go on, put &#8217;em in&ndash;&ndash;please,
Meg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg seldom could resist anything Bobby
asked of her, and Dot was always ready to follow
her older sister&#8217;s lead. So Geraldine and
Mary Maud were placed inside the tower of
chairs and stools and rugs that Bobby and Twaddles
called their house, and the architect set
himself to work to construct the chimney.</p>
<p>The children who were so busily employed in
the pleasant living-room this rainy September
afternoon were known to all their friends as
&#8220;the four little Blossoms.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>There was a Father Blossom and a Mother
Blossom, of course, and when you were introduced
to the children separately&ndash;&ndash;though the
four were usually to be found, as Norah, the
good-natured maid, said, &#8220;right in a bunch&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;you
met Robert Hayward Blossom, always
known as Bobby, seven years old and as devoted
a brother to six-year-old Margaret Alice as you
would ever find. Margaret was much better
known as Meg.</p>
<p>Then came the twins, Dot and Twaddles. And
a pair they were, into everything and remarkable
for the ease with which they managed to get out
of scrapes for which they were generally responsible.
The twins were four years old, dark-haired
and dark-eyed, while Bobby and Meg
had blue eyes and yellow hair.</p>
<p>The Blossoms lived in the pretty town of Oak
Hill, and they knew nearly every one. Indeed
the children had never been away from Oak
Hill till the visit they had made to their Aunt
Polly, about which you may have read in the
book called &#8220;Four Little Blossoms at Brookside
Farm.&#8221; They had spent the summer with Aunt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
Polly, and had made many new friends and
learned a great deal about animals. Meg, especially,
loved all dumb creatures. And now that
you are acquainted with the four little Blossoms,
we must get back to that chimney.</p>
<p>&#8220;The umbrella rack will do,&#8221; suggested
Twaddles suddenly.</p>
<p>He ran out into the hall and dragged the
rack in.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine,&#8221; said Bobby enthusiastically.
&#8220;Come on, Twaddles, help me lift it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strangers always thought that Twaddles was
such an odd name. Perhaps it was; and certainly
no one knew how the small boy had
acquired it. &#8220;Twaddles&#8221; he was though, and
he himself almost forgot that he had a &#8220;real&#8221;
name, which was Arthur Gifford. His twin was
never called Dorothy, either, but always &#8220;Dot.&#8221;
Dorothy Anna Blossom was the whole of Dot&#8217;s
name.</p>
<p>Twaddles now heaved and tugged, trying to
help Bobby lift the heavy umbrella rack. He
was elated that he had thought of it, and not for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
worlds would he have admitted that it was exceedingly
heavy to lift.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; said Bobby, when they had it finally
in place. &#8220;How&#8217;s that for a house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Meg began.</p>
<p>She meant to say &#8220;perfectly wonderful,&#8221; but
just then Twaddles jumped down to the floor
from the pile. In doing this he jarred the wonderful
structure, and with a crash that could be
heard all over the house, umbrella rack, stools,
chairs and rugs slithered together in a complete
wreck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Geraldine!&#8221; shrieked Dot. &#8220;She&#8217;ll be
smashed and killed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the love of mercy, what are ye doing
now?&#8221; The long-suffering but not always patient
Norah stood in the doorway. &#8220;Bobby, what are
ye up to the minute your mother turns her back?
Is Dot hurt? What&#8217;s she crying for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Norah always asked a great many questions,
and it was of no use, as the children had learned
from experience, to try to answer her till she
had had her say.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are ye trying to do?&#8221; asked Norah
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
again. &#8220;&#8217;Tis fine and peaceful the summer has
been with ye all at Brookside. And now the minute
you&#8217;re home again, the house must be torn
down about our ears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were building a house, Norah,&#8221; explained
Bobby. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to put everything
back when we&#8217;re through. Oh, hush, Dot, Geraldine
isn&#8217;t hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>To prove it, Bobby crawled in under the
wreckage and dragged out the smiling Geraldine
apparently uninjured. But as Dot took the
doll in her arms a dreadful thing happened.</p>
<p>Geraldine&#8217;s head tumbled off!</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms gasped with horror,
and even Norah was startled. Then, as Dot&#8217;s
mouth opened for a loud wail, Meg came to the
relief of every one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy can mend it, Dot,&#8221; she urged earnestly.
&#8220;See, it is cracked right across and there
aren&#8217;t any chips out. &#8217;Member how he mended
Mother&#8217;s china cup and she can wash it in hot
water and everything? Can&#8217;t she, Norah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure then, she can,&#8221; said Norah heartily.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t go crying now, Dot; the doll can be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
mended as fine as ever. Put up the furniture
like good children, do. Your mother will be
coming home any minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor little Dot tried to stop crying, and the
four youngsters rather solemnly set about the
task of leaving things as they had found them,
which, as you know yourself, isn&#8217;t half as much
fun as getting them out to play with. However,
everything was in its place before Mother Blossom
came home, and after supper that night
Father Blossom put some of his wonderful
cement on Geraldine&#8217;s neck, and over night her
head, as Dot said, &#8220;grew on beautifully and
tight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we had a cat,&#8221; said Meg the next
morning, as she and Bobby went out to the
garage to carry their dog&#8217;s breakfast to him.</p>
<p>Meg had made the same wish nearly every
morning for the last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we have a dog,&#8221; Bobby pointed out
reasonably. &#8220;And you know Norah can&#8217;t bear
cats.&#8221;</p>
<p>Philip, the dog, came leaping to meet them,
and he was followed by Sam Layton, the man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
who ran the automobile for the Blossoms and cut
the lawn and did all the hundred and one useful
jobs that are always waiting to be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Sam!&#8221; Meg&#8217;s voice rose in a surprised
cry. &#8220;Why, Sam, what a perfectly lovely cat!
Whose is it, and where did it come from? Let
me hold her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam put the soft bundle of gray fur into Meg&#8217;s
arms, and Philip sat down on the grass and tried
to look patient. He foresaw that he would have
to wait for his breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s your cat,&#8221; Sam announced. &#8220;Leastways,
I told Norah when you got home you were
to have her. Her name is Annabel Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Annabel Lee!&#8221; repeated the astonished Meg.
&#8220;Did you name her, Sam?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly did,&#8221; answered Sam proudly.
&#8220;Your father read me one of your letters where
you said your Aunt Polly&#8217;s cat was named
&#8216;Poots&#8217;; and I said then and there our cat was
going to have a poetry name. And she&#8217;s got it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very nice name,&#8221; said Bobby. &#8220;But
does Norah know we have a cat?&#8221;</p>
<p>Whenever the four little Blossoms had teased
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
for a cat, Norah had always flatly declared she
wouldn&#8217;t have one within a mile of her kitchen;
and the children knew that a cat that was never
allowed in a kitchen could not expect to be
happy. So they had managed to get along without
such a pet.</p>
<p>&#8220;This cat,&#8221; announced Sam mysteriously,
&#8220;was sent for by Norah. She wants it. In fact,
she as much as said she wouldn&#8217;t stay if your
father didn&#8217;t get a cat.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>SCHOOL SUPPLIES</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Norah wanted a cat!&#8221; repeated Meg unbelievingly.
&#8220;But why? I thought she
hated cats, Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mice,&#8221; said Sam. &#8220;Traps no good. But
Annabel Lee is clearing &#8217;em out, all right. She&#8217;s
a fine mouser. And the prettiest manners! You
put the dish down and watch her and Fill-Up
eat together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg found it rather trying that Sam would
insist on calling the dog she had named Philip
by such an impolite title, but Sam always had
his way about such things. Meg put down the
dish with Philip&#8217;s breakfast in it, and he and the
cat ate together as though they had been friends
all their lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meg, Meg!&#8221; called Dot, running toward
them. &#8220;Miss Florence is here, and Mother says
you must come in right away and try on. Oh,
whose cat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Annabel Lee,&#8221; said Meg. &#8220;She&#8217;s our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
cat. Sam got her &#8217;cause mice were in the
kitchen. I&#8217;m going to take her in and show her
to Miss Florence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me hold her,&#8221; begged Dot. &#8220;You have
to try on. Look, Twaddles, bet you didn&#8217;t know
we had a cat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles stopped short on his kiddie-car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell Norah,&#8221; he whispered cautiously.
&#8220;Take her in the front door and she won&#8217;t know.
Did Mother say we could have a cat?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Norah asked for a cat,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come on,
Twaddles, let&#8217;s teach Philip to jump through a
hoop. The girls are going to fuss with clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg tossed her yellow hair out of her eyes
importantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to have the hems of some dresses let
down,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;I grew in the country.
Mother says so. &#8217;Sides when you go to school
you have to be neat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nina Mills isn&#8217;t neat,&#8221; argued Dot, toiling
upstairs after Meg, and holding Annabel Lee&#8217;s
long tail so that she might feel she was having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
a share in carrying her. &#8220;She goes to school,
Meg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she&#8217;s a sight,&#8221; pronounced Meg.
&#8220;Mother wouldn&#8217;t let me look the way Nina
Mills does. Look, Miss Florence, we got a cat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you say &#8216;got a cat&#8217; in school, Meg, I&#8217;m
sure something will happen to you,&#8221; warned
Mother Blossom, bending over the sewing
machine. &#8220;Miss Florence wants to try the green
dress on you, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Florence Davis was the little dressmaker
who went about making clothes for many of the
people who lived in Oak Hill. Every one liked
her, and she was always as happy as busy folk
usually are.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a beautiful cat,&#8221; she said, stroking
Annabel Lee&#8217;s fur. &#8220;Now I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re contented,
Meg, with a cat and a dog. Aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she&#8217;s going to school, too,&#8221; announced
Dot enviously, sitting down on the floor to watch
Meg as she put on the new green dress. &#8220;Here,
Annabel, come sit in my lap.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cat curled up in Dot&#8217;s lap and purred
loudly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to go to school?&#8221; asked Miss
Florence sympathetically, taking a mouthful of
pins and kneeling down to pin up the hem of
Meg&#8217;s frock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twaddles and I both want to go,&#8221; answered
Dot. &#8220;But that mean old school won&#8217;t let you
come till you&#8217;re five&ndash;&ndash;not even to kindergarten.
Did you swallow any?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any what?&#8221; asked Miss Florence absently,
still pinning the hem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pins,&#8221; said Dot interestedly. &#8220;I counted
three I thought you did. Will they hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg looked down at Miss Florence anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless your heart, I didn&#8217;t swallow any pins!&#8221;
declared the little dressmaker, smiling. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
bad trick, though, and I always mean to break
myself of it. There, Dot, I&#8217;ve taken every one
out of my mouth. And now walk over by the
door, Meg, and let your mother see if that is the
right length.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn &#8217;round slowly,&#8221; ordered Dot, as Meg
reached the door. Dot had watched a great
many dresses being fitted and she knew exactly
what one should do.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>Meg laughed, and began to revolve slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that is a very good length,&#8221; said
Mother Blossom. &#8220;We shan&#8217;t need her again
till after lunch, shall we, Miss Florence? I want
her to go uptown and get some elastic for her
hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the school things, Mother?&#8221; urged
Meg. &#8220;Can Bobby and I buy our school things
this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what you want?&#8221; asked Mother
Blossom. &#8220;I saw Miss Mason yesterday, and
she said you don&#8217;t need very many things, Meg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother, Twaddles and I need some
crayons,&#8221; said Dot, tumbling Annabel Lee out
of her lap, much to that sleepy animal&#8217;s surprise
and disapproval. &#8220;And a pencil box with a
lock, Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to school,&#8221; retorted Meg.
&#8220;Is she, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom put down her sewing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why my twinnies are so eager to
go to school,&#8221; she said sadly. &#8220;What in the wide
world should I do if all my children went off
to school and left me alone? Perhaps, Dot, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
and Twaddles and I can have our own kindergarten
after Meg and Bobby get nicely started.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With a blackboard?&#8221; demanded Dot. &#8220;And
inkwells and a cloak room, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom and Miss Florence laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I begin to think the other children are the
attraction, not school,&#8221; said Mother Blossom.
&#8220;However, Meg must run along if she is to be
back by lunch time. I&#8217;ll give you and Bobby
each fifty cents, dear. And suppose Dot and
Twaddles have a quarter each to spend? Going
to school without a shiny new pencil box isn&#8217;t
to be thought of, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg and Dot ran downstairs and found
Twaddles and Bobby had tired of teaching
Philip to jump through a hoop, and were busily
cracking stones in the driveway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of &#8217;em might be valuable,&#8221; said Bobby,
when Meg asked him why he was doing that.
&#8220;I heard a boy talking about it once. Might
have gold or iron ore in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re going uptown to buy elastic and
school things,&#8221; said Meg. &#8220;Mother gave me the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
money in this purse. Fifty cents is for you, and
the twins can spend a quarter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms set off on their errand,
and Philip tagged along after them. He
wasn&#8217;t interested in school supplies, but he
dearly loved a walk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get the &#8217;lastic first,&#8221; decided Meg, when
they reached the street where most of the Oak
Hill stores were. &#8220;Don&#8217;t buy anything till I
get that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others waited while the elastic was measured
and wrapped, and after Meg had paid for
it they went over to the fascinating counter
where all the things one needs in school were displayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said a girl who was looking at a
blank book when the four little Blossoms came
up. &#8220;You been away?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was Nina Mills. She was an untidy
looking child and her hands were not very clean.
But she smiled pleasantly enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been in the country,&#8221; Meg informed
her, as Bobby and Twaddles and Dot apparently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
couldn&#8217;t find anything to say. &#8220;We went
to see our Aunt Polly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Nina Mills. &#8220;That&#8217;s nice. I wish
I could go off on visits. You coming to school
Monday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bobby and I are,&#8221; Meg answered. &#8220;The
twins are too little.&#8221;</p>
<p>The twins frankly scowled. How they did
hate being &#8220;too young&#8221; to do so many things they
wished to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re too little,&#8221; agreed Nina Mills.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll be in Miss Mason&#8217;s room. So&#8217;m I.
I&#8217;m in Bobby&#8217;s class. Well, I guess I have to
go now. Good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; said the four little Blossoms awkwardly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now hurry up and let&#8217;s get our things &#8217;fore
any one else comes,&#8221; proposed Bobby, who did
not like to talk to people he did not know very
well. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to buy this ruler that folds
up, Meg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg was busy trying a key in a pencil box.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fifty cents and I can&#8217;t get anything else,
but look at all the things in it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Pencils
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
and rubbers and pens. I guess I&#8217;ll take this
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The twins were examining a box of crayons
and Dot was sure that she could learn to write
only with the box that held the most colors.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I want two blotting papers, pink and
blue,&#8221; she told the good-natured saleswoman.
&#8220;An&#8217; a pencil with a blue stone in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take these chalk ones,&#8221; decided Twaddles,
choosing a box of soft, chalky crayons. &#8220;I&#8217;d
like a bottle of glue, too, and a red book.&#8221;</p>
<p>The red book was a little cash account book
such as Twaddles had seen Father Blossom use.</p>
<p>With their parcels neatly tied up, the four
little Blossoms started back home, Philip trotting
on ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s walk around by the school,&#8221; suggested
Meg. &#8220;It&#8217;s only the next block and we&#8217;ve plenty
of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, let&#8217;s,&#8221; assented Bobby. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show
you Miss Mason&#8217;s room.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>STARTING SCHOOL</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; explained Bobby, as the children
turned down the street that led past the
schoolhouse, &#8220;primary school isn&#8217;t so awfully
important. That&#8217;s why the grammar and high
school got the new building; I heard old Hornbeck
say so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t call him old Hornbeck,&#8221; said
Meg reprovingly. &#8220;Mother says it isn&#8217;t respectful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby didn&#8217;t answer, for they had reached the
primary school building and he was busy counting
windows to find Miss Mason&#8217;s room. The
Oak Hill primary grades occupied an old building
on a corner lot, while the grammar and high
schools were housed in a handsome modern
building a few blocks away, with a playground
and even an extra lot for the school gardens.
But the primary children really had a better
time by themselves, and were certainly spared a
great amount of teasing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Five, six,&#8221; finished Bobby. &#8220;There&ndash;&ndash;see
the sixth window on the second floor? That&#8217;s
our room, Meg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg gazed interestedly at the window that
looked exactly like all the other windows and
yet was different to her because it was a part of
the schoolroom she had never seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Miss Mason cross, Bobby?&#8221; she asked
timidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not always,&#8221; said Bobby encouragingly.
&#8220;Course if you whisper or giggle, or chew
chewing gum&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;My! how she does hate chewing
gum,&#8221; he added. &#8220;But most times she is
nice. And you ought to hear her read stories!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Mason taught two sections of the first
and second years, and so it happened that Meg
would be in the same room with Bobby, although
this was her first year at school and his
second. Last year Meg had gone to a small
private kindergarten, but she was very eager to
go to what she called a &#8220;real school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s mean we can&#8217;t go,&#8221; complained
Twaddles, scuffing his feet moodily as Bobby
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
and Meg went on ahead. &#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t hurt
their old school!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they&#8217;ll be sorry,&#8221; said Dot. &#8220;Some
day they&#8217;ll want us to go to school and we
won&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lunch was ready when the four little Blossoms
reached home, and after lunch more
dresses were waiting for Meg to try on. Miss
Florence came and sewed another day, and then,
finally, the first morning of the school term arrived.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear this is a very important day,&#8221; announced
Father Blossom smilingly at breakfast.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me it is a birthday, and I&#8217;ve forgotten
all about it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg dimpled.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t a birthday, Daddy,&#8221; she declared.</p>
<p>Father Blossom pretended to be very much
worried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it isn&#8217;t Christmas,&#8221; he said anxiously,
&#8220;because it isn&#8217;t cold enough. And it can&#8217;t be
the Fourth of July. What day is it, Meg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The first day of school!&#8221; pronounced Meg
triumphantly. &#8220;And I&#8217;m going. See, I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
on a new dress, and here&#8217;s my pencil case, and
my hat has new elastic&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! well! well!&#8221; exclaimed Father Blossom,
&#8220;is it possible? My eldest daughter old
enough to go to school! I suppose in another year
or so the twins will be clamoring for pencil
cases and we won&#8217;t have any children who have
time to play.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could go to school now,&#8221; scolded Twaddles,
&#8220;only everybody says I&#8217;m too young.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Father Blossom comfortably.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve years of school ahead of you,
Son. Does Mother have to go this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No indeed,&#8221; answered Mother Blossom
cheerfully. &#8220;I&#8217;ve already seen Miss Mason
about Meg, and as she is going to be in the same
room with Bobby, he will look after her. And
if you don&#8217;t want to be late the first morning,
children, I think you should start in a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole family followed Meg and Bobby
to the door to see them off, and even Norah left
her morning work to wave good-by to them.
Philip and Annabel Lee and Sam were standing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
in the garage door to see them go, and altogether
the two scholars felt rather important.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Fred Baldwin,&#8221; said Bobby, spying
a boy just ahead of them. &#8220;He&#8217;s in my grade.
Hey, Fred!&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy turned and waited for them to come
up with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; he said shyly, &#8220;going to school,
Bobby?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; replied Bobby. &#8220;Here is my sister
Meg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred and Meg said &#8220;Hello,&#8221; and the three
walked along rapidly toward the schoolhouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you have Miss Mason last year?&#8221; Fred
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You had Miss Watts, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; said
Bobby. &#8220;Is she cross?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Awful,&#8221; confided Fred sadly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet I
stayed in three nights a week regular.&#8221;</p>
<p>His dancing black eyes seemed to say that he
had had a good time in school, no matter if he
had been kept in; indeed Fred was a mischievous-looking
child, and his own mother was inclined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
to think, as she often told him, that Miss
Watts probably could tell another story.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to take Meg up and let her get her
seat,&#8221; announced Bobby when they reached the
school yard. &#8220;You coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred thought he would stay down and see
some of the boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care where I sit,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;And
if you go in late most all the front seats have
been given out. I&#8217;d rather sit in the back of the
room.&#8221;</p>
<p>So you see Fred did have a choice, though he
said, and probably honestly thought, he did not.</p>
<p>Meg followed Bobby upstairs and into a large
square room half filled with chattering children.
A gray-haired lady was speaking to the young
woman who stood near a desk on a small platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Miss Wright, the vice-principal,&#8221;
whispered Bobby, indicating the gray-haired
woman. &#8220;Mr. Carter, over at the grammar
school, is the real principal. If you&#8217;re real bad,
Miss Wright sends for him. But she opens
assembly and like-a-that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>Presently Miss Wright went out, and Bobby
led Meg up to the teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my sister Meg,&#8221; he said politely.
&#8220;She hasn&#8217;t any seat yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Margaret?&#8221; said Miss Mason,
smiling. &#8220;Your name is really Margaret,
isn&#8217;t it? I like to use my pupils&#8217; full names. I&#8217;m
sorry your sister can&#8217;t sit with you, Robert, but
I can&#8217;t mix the grades. You may have any seat
on this aisle, Margaret.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor Meg found it most confusing to be called
Margaret, and was almost startled to hear Bobby
addressed as &#8220;Robert.&#8221; Father Blossom occasionally
called him that, but only when he meant
to scold him. But Meg sensibly supposed that
when one went to school there were a number of
new things to get used to, and it seemed that
names were to be among them.</p>
<p>She chose a seat half-way down the aisle and
in a direct row with Bobby&#8217;s, which was on the
other side of the room. And by the time she had
made her choice and put away her pencil box,
Miss Mason announced that it was five minutes
of nine and that no child should leave the room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>Clang! A harsh gong rang through the halls.
Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>The noise in the school yard ceased with a suddenness
that was surprising. The gong rang
again and a trampling and scuffling through the
halls announced that the boys and girls were
marching up to their classrooms. Miss Mason
took her place at the door, and as a long line
marched into her room she directed them where
to sit. Meg wondered what she was to do with
her hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beginning with the first aisle, the girls may
go to the cloak room and hang up their hats,&#8221;
announced Miss Mason, just as if Meg had
spoken aloud. &#8220;Then after all the girls have
returned, the boys may go, aisle by aisle. And
I want no whispering or unnecessary delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the last of the boys had found a hook
for his cap, clang! went the gong again and a
piano some distance away sounded a lively
march.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand!&#8221; said Miss Mason. &#8220;Margaret, you
may lead the line. Come here.&#8221; Meg stood
quietly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Margaret Blossom!&#8221; and this time Miss Mason&#8217;s
voice sounded impatient. &#8220;Is the child
dreaming? You&#8217;re holding back the whole
room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg blushed and came forward hastily. To
tell the truth, she had not realized that Miss
Mason was speaking to her&ndash;&ndash;the unfamiliar
&#8220;Margaret&#8221; bewildered her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your place here,&#8221; commanded Miss
Mason, pushing her gently into a place in the
doorway. &#8220;And when you see the last child leave
that room opposite, wheel in after her and follow
to the auditorium.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg looked around for Bobby. He was near
the end of the long line that had formed around
the sides of the room, and when he caught his
sister&#8217;s eye he grinned and nodded encouragingly
to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do all right,&#8221; he seemed to say.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE DEAD SNAKE</h3>
</div>
<p>A little girl in a checked gingham dress
was at the end of the line of children who
marched out from the room across the hall, and,
obedient to a look from Miss Mason, Meg followed
her. Down the corridor, up three steps
and into a round, light room they marched,
the piano tinkling steadily. Meg saw now that
it was on the platform, and, goodness! the player
was a small girl who didn&#8217;t look much older
than Meg herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you take music lessons?&#8221; whispered a girl
next to Meg, as they turned down a row of seats
facing the platform and other children rapidly
filled up the rows back of them. &#8220;You do?
Well, when you get in the third grade you&#8217;ll
have to play for &#8217;em to march. Miss Wright
makes all the third and fourth graders who can
play anything learn an assembly march.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg was glad that she was only in the first
grade, and yet she thought that it must be exciting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
to sit at a piano away up on a high platform
and play for the whole school. She wondered
if, by practicing faithfully, she could learn an
assembly march by the time she reached the third
grade.</p>
<p>The girl at the piano played a crashing chord,
and the children dropped into their seats with a
concerted fervor that shook the walls. Miss
Wright, the gray-haired vice-principal Meg had
seen in her room talking to Miss Mason, opened
the large Bible that lay on the desk, and, facing
the children, read a few verses. Then the little
piano girl played for the hymn they sang, finding
the books in racks on the backs of the seats.
Next Miss Wright made them a little speech, in
which she said she hoped they were all rested
from the long vacation and would work hard so
that every one might be promoted at the end of
the term.</p>
<p>&#8220;She always says that,&#8221; whispered the girl
next to Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; asked Meg, whispering,
too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve been to school for most three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
years,&#8221; said the other girl proudly. &#8220;You first
grade? Do you have Miss Mason or Miss
Watts? Miss Mason! Oh, gee, she&#8217;s as cross
as anything. I had her my first year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg opened her mouth to say that she liked
Miss Mason, but the bell rang again and the
children rose and turned toward the aisles. The
small girl at the piano rattled another lively
march, and in orderly lines the children
marched back to their classrooms. Assembly
was over for that morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a minute, before we begin our writing
lesson,&#8221; announced Miss Mason when, with
some noise and fluttering, her classes had found
their seats. &#8220;I believe in trusting my pupils
to a great extent; I can not watch you every
minute. Besides, you know as well as I do when
you do wrong. I want to know how many of
you whispered in the auditorium this morning.
Raise your hands, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor Meg&#8217;s eyes widened in horror. For a
moment she was furious at the girl who had
spoken to her and so tempted her to whisper.
But if Meg was only six years old she was an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
honest little girl and she knew that in any case
she might have whispered. The third-grade
girl was probably trying to be friendly, too.</p>
<p>Meg raised her hand. There were half a
dozen other hands in the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tim Roon and Charlie Black. I might
have known you would talk,&#8221; said Miss Mason
severely. &#8220;I remember you last term. You may
each stay after school this afternoon for twenty
minutes. You, too, Alice Cray. I&#8217;m surprised
at you. And Margaret Blossom&ndash;&ndash;a first-grader,
whispering her very first morning. Don&#8217;t you
know it is against the rules to whisper in assembly,
Margaret?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand when you speak,&#8221; said Miss Mason,
who certainly was rather severe in her manner.
&#8220;Did you or didn&#8217;t you know you were breaking
the rules?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;didn&#8217;t think about the rules,&#8221; stammered
Meg, rising and holding on to her desk
with both small hands. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t know you
were going to ask us if we whispered!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Mason&#8217;s eyes suddenly crinkled. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
was laughing! When she laughed you saw that
she really wasn&#8217;t cross.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll forgive you this
time. But I will ask this question every morning,
so don&#8217;t whisper again unless you are prepared
to take the consequences. Now first-graders,
take your copy books.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg found her copy book already on her
desk, and she was so interested in trying to make
a page of letters that would look exactly like
those already drawn on the top line that she
never looked up when the second grade had
their arithmetic lesson at the blackboard. And
when the bell rang for recess, she jumped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t stay in here, go down and out
into the fresh air,&#8221; directed Miss Mason, busily
putting up all the windows as high as they
would go. &#8220;Out with you, every one!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was warm and sunny on the playground,
and Meg was soon drawn into a game of jack-stones
with Nina Mills and a little girl from
her own class. Bobby wandered off to a corner
where a group of boys were gathered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>Tim Roon and Charlie Black were bending
over something on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be mean,&#8221; a boy just back of them said
as Bobby came up.</p>
<p>Tim Roon and Charlie Black were chums and
older than the majority of children in Miss
Mason&#8217;s room. They had taken two years for
the first grade, and gave every evidence of
spending two years in the second grade. It
wasn&#8217;t that they found their lessons difficult, but
rather that they didn&#8217;t try, and sometimes it
almost seemed that they preferred to be bad.
They played hooky, and broke all the rules they
could, and when they were in school idled their
time away, played tricks on the other boys, or
else spent hours in the office of the vice-principal
awaiting the attention of Mr. Carter, the real
principal, of whom even Tim Roon was secretly
afraid.</p>
<p>&#8220;You keep out of this,&#8221; said Tim rudely, as
Bobby tried to look over his shoulder.</p>
<p>But Bobby had already seen, and with a quick
shove of his foot he kicked away a stone. A
small green snake glided rapidly off into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
grass. Another snake, mashed and dead, lay in
the dust.</p>
<p>&#8220;You keep your hands off my things!&#8221; shouted
Tim Roon. &#8220;I got that snake, and if you think
you can go round interfering&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like as not you&#8217;ll be bit when that snake
grows up; and it&#8217;ll serve you right, too,&#8221; chimed
in Charlie Black, who had red hair and freckles
oddly at variance with his name.</p>
<p>Bobby was angry, too, and his small face was
as red as the old turkey&#8217;s that lived at Brookside
Farm.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to kill a snake, you don&#8217;t have
to mash it and hurt it,&#8221; he told Tim heatedly.
&#8220;You like to kill things. Water snakes are
harmless&ndash;&ndash;Sam Layton says so. You cut up that
other snake &#8217;fore you killed it; and you let me
find you doing that to a live snake, or anything
else that can feel, and I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The bell rang then and Bobby didn&#8217;t have
time to say what he would do. Tim Roon and
Charlie Black walked off toward the school
building ignoring Bobby, and the other boys
followed, looking a little ashamed. They had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
watched Tim torture the snake without thinking
much about it. If a snake had feelings they had
never considered them. And yet they did not
mean to be cruel.</p>
<p>Bobby stayed to bury the dead snake. This
made him late, and Miss Mason scolded him
roundly. Bobby took his seat wishing that he
could get even with Tim Roon. That is not a
sensible feeling for any one to have, and it never
yet made the boy or girl, or grown-up for that
matter, who had it, either happy or comfortable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it is a warm afternoon, and I suppose
you find it hard to settle down to work after
a summer of play,&#8221; said Miss Mason, suddenly
looking up from the list of spelling words she
was dictating to the second grade that afternoon,
&#8220;but I do not see any excuse for this incessant
noise. James Willard, what have you
in that bag?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; answered James stolidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing! Nonsense, you couldn&#8217;t be rattling
an empty bag,&#8221; snapped Miss Mason. &#8220;Bring
it to me instantly.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>James tramped heavily up the aisle and
handed the teacher the bag. It was empty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve eaten the candy,&#8221; said Miss
Mason suspiciously. &#8220;You may stay after school
and fill all the inkwells. Now go to your seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg watched James as he took his seat.
While he had been at the desk she had seen
Charlie Black lean over&ndash;&ndash;he sat directly behind
James&ndash;&ndash;and take something from James&#8217; seat.
It was a large lump of yellow taffy.</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t eat it,&#8221; thought Meg. &#8220;He&#8217;ll have
to wait till after school. Poor James won&#8217;t dare
say a word.&#8221;</p>
<p>And James didn&#8217;t. When he found his candy
gone he looked around at Charlie and scowled,
for he guessed Charlie had stolen it, but he did
not dare complain. Charlie grinned pleasantly
at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charles Black, go to the board,&#8221; directed
Miss Mason half an hour later. &#8220;We have just
time to go over to-morrow&#8217;s lesson in multiplication.
Take the figures I give you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Mason looked impatiently at Charlie.
He remained in his seat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go,&#8221; he objected when she continued
to stare at him. &#8220;Can&#8217;t I do it from here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not. Go to the board this instant,&#8221;
retorted Miss Mason. &#8220;Charles, do you hear
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, I can&#8217;t go,&#8221; wailed Charlie Black.
&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I won&#8217;t go!&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg gasped. Even Miss Mason looked surprised.</p>
<p>Then she walked over to the door and opened
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may go down to the principal&#8217;s office,&#8221;
she said coldly. &#8220;No boy can remain in my
room who refuses to obey me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie&#8217;s face was red, and he refused to meet
the teacher&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you I can&#8217;t go,&#8221; he muttered again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>ANOTHER SCHOOLROOM</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Charles Black!&#8221; ejaculated Miss
Mason, &#8220;what do you mean by this nonsense?
You can&#8217;t go to the blackboard, and you
can&#8217;t go downstairs. Are you sick? Why can&#8217;t
you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie half rose from his seat, then sank
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m stuck fast!&#8221; he wailed. &#8220;It&#8217;s the taffy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The class began to laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; Miss Mason checked them.
&#8220;Where did you get this taffy, Charles?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I took it,&#8221; admitted Charlie sullenly. &#8220;I
was sitting on it to keep till after school, and
it&#8217;s melted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Mason sat down at her desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dismissal bell will ring in a few minutes,&#8221;
she observed. &#8220;As usual, we shall have
no afternoon school the first day. All those I
have asked to remain will stay of course. I
won&#8217;t have to ask you to stay after the session,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
Charles. You haven&#8217;t much choice in the matter.
We&#8217;ll discuss this more fully later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My, I wouldn&#8217;t want to be in his shoes!&#8221; said
Bobby, as he and Meg walked home. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t
you hungry, Meg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Starved,&#8221; agreed Meg. &#8220;What do you suppose
the twins have been doing all the morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the twins had been busy.
The moment Bobby and Meg left they began to
play school.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be the teacher,&#8221; declared Twaddles,
&#8220;and I want a lot of scholars. Get the dolls,
Dot, and Philip and Annabel Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the crayons,&#8221; suggested Dot. &#8220;Where&#8217;ll
we play?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the sitting room,&#8221; decided Twaddles.
&#8220;There&#8217;s more chairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot collected Geraldine and another of her
dolls, Totty-Fay, and Meg&#8217;s doll, Mary Maud,
and trotted out to the garage to get Philip and
the cat, Annabel Lee. When she returned with
these pets, Twaddles had the chairs drawn up
in two rows and the dolls already in their places.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You and Philip and Annabel Lee can sit up
in front,&#8221; he said generously. &#8220;This piano bench
is my desk. Want to come to school, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom, who had stopped in to see
what they were doing, shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t time to go to school this morning,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Twaddles, if you are the schoolmaster,
wouldn&#8217;t you like these old rims to play
with? I always used to want to wear glasses
when I played school as a little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles took the horn-rimmed spectacles
joyfully. There was no glass in them, but they
gave him a very learned, important look. Indeed,
Philip stared at him perfectly fascinated.</p>
<p>&#8220;The class in reading will now recite,&#8221; announced
Teacher Twaddles in his severest voice.
&#8220;Come up to the platform, little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot obediently rose and went up to the piano
bench.</p>
<p>&#8220;Read the first page of this,&#8221; commanded
Twaddles, handing her a book. &#8220;Make a bow
first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot ducked stiffly. The dolls watched her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
unwinkingly and the dog and cat apparently
wondered what would happen next.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now begin,&#8221; said Twaddles.</p>
<p>Neither he nor Dot could read, but they knew
a number of poems by heart, and when they pretended
to read they always held a book and
repeated some of their favorite rhymes. So now
Dot recited as much of &#8220;The Night Before
Christmas&#8221; as she could remember.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said the teacher graciously.
&#8220;Take your seat. The class in geography will
please recite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Geraldine and Mary Maud obligingly moved
forward and told the capital city of the United
States, and which state was the nicest to live in
and where the Atlantic Ocean was. They spoke
in high, squeaky voices that made Philip prick
up his ears suspiciously, but they received a
&#8220;perfect&#8221; mark in the teacher&#8217;s book.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we could go to regular school,&#8221;
mourned Dot suddenly. &#8220;Do you s&#8217;pose Meg
and Bobby are having a good time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s ask Mother if we can go to meet &#8217;em,&#8221;
proposed Twaddles. &#8220;Come on.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>Mother Blossom, when they asked her, said
that school would be out in ten or fifteen minutes
and that she had no objection if they wanted
to walk up town and meet the others.</p>
<p>Twaddles and Dot put the chairs back where
they belonged and carried the dolls upstairs to
the bedroom Meg and Dot shared together.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take Philip and Annabel Lee,&#8221; said
Dot. &#8220;I guess Meg will be glad to see them,
she&#8217;s been gone so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>So as Meg and Bobby turned into their street,
they saw the twins coming to meet them.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you like school?&#8221; shouted Twaddles.
&#8220;Is it fun? Did you have to recite? Look how
glad Philip is to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed the dog was leaping and barking about
Meg as though she had been gone all summer
instead of one morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness, what did you lug that cat for?&#8221;
demanded Bobby, big-brother fashion. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
torn some of the gathers in your dress, too, Dot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t care,&#8221; said Dot, giving Annabel Lee
over to Meg with a sigh of relief, for the cat was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
heavy. &#8220;I caught it on a nail coming down the
steps. Twaddles and I played school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I led the line, going in to assembly,&#8221; reported
Meg importantly. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Mother? I want
to tell her.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had reached the house by this time, and
the little Blossoms dashed up the stairs to find
their mother and tell her all the news. The
twins listened eagerly, for the slightest word
about school never failed to enthrall them.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I think Tim Roon is hateful,&#8221; concluded
Bobby, when he had finished telling Mother
Blossom about the unfortunate snake. &#8220;And
Charlie Black is just like him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, children,&#8221; said Mother Blossom firmly,
&#8220;you needn&#8217;t tell me any child is hateful, I
don&#8217;t care who he is or what he does. You may
think this Tim Roon hasn&#8217;t a single pleasant
trait, but that doesn&#8217;t prove that he has none,
only that you are not able to find it. Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s
have talk like this. If you find your other classmates
friendly and pleasant, think as little about
the disagreeable ones as you can. There&#8217;s the
lunch gong.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>After the meal the four children went out to
the garage to find out what Sam Layton was going
to do that afternoon, because he often had
interesting plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought you had to go to school,&#8221; Sam
greeted Meg and Bobby. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t in the kindergarten,
are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know we&#8217;re not,&#8221; answered Bobby indignantly.
&#8220;First day they always have one
session, so&#8217;s the teachers can get their records
fixed up. Are you going to take the car out,
Sam?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes,&#8221; admitted Sam. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got orders
to meet your father at the foundry at two
o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take us?&#8221; begged Meg. &#8220;Daddy won&#8217;t care.
Dot, you run and ask Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t take you,&#8221; Sam informed her regretfully.
&#8220;Your father&#8217;s going on to Clayton for
a meeting. Maybe we won&#8217;t get back till eight
or nine o&#8217;clock to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg thought this over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take us as far as the foundry,&#8221; she suggested.
&#8220;We can walk home.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and maybe I&#8217;ll find some specimens,&#8221;
said Bobby. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go and get my bag and hammer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby meant the little hammer he used to
crack stones with and the bag he kept to put
the cracked bits in. Bobby was very much interested
in pebbles and stones. He thought some
day he might succeed in finding a valuable piece
of mineral.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ask your mother if it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; insisted
Sam, beginning to brush his suit and getting
out his cap and gloves from the wall closet.
&#8220;You&#8217;re going to be on hand, Dot, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot had already climbed into the car and was
sitting on the front seat smiling serenely at the
others. She looked very pretty in a fresh pink
frock that had replaced the torn dress before
lunch, and her cheeks were pink, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother says all right, but we mustn&#8217;t go a
bit further than the foundry,&#8221; reported Bobby,
coming back in a few minutes with his precious
hammer and little white canvas bag. &#8220;Let me
drive, Sam?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; responded Sam promptly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach you to drive, Bobby, the day you&#8217;re
old enough to run a car and not one minute
before. In with you now, Meg?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg shook her head. It was impossible to induce
her to get in the car and be comfortable
while Sam was backing it down the long driveway
into the street. The other children never
thought anything about it, but Meg was always
afraid that the car would tip over, and no
amount of persuasion or reasoning could change
her.</p>
<p>She ran down to the curb now, and waited till
the car rolled out. Sam stopped and she jumped
in. Sam was very fond of Meg and never made
fun of her, as the twins often did, because she
was afraid to trust him to get out of the driveway
safely.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fine day for a drive,&#8221; commented Sam,
as the car moved off smoothly. &#8220;Mercy on us,
what&#8217;s that under the seat?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>AN UNPLEASANT MEETING</h3>
</div>
<p>It proved to be Philip under the seat, and
he rolled his eyes beseechingly at Sam as
Bobby pulled him out by his collar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which one of you kids hid him under the
seat?&#8221; demanded Sam sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t, honestly, Sam,&#8221; said Meg.</p>
<p>Bobby and the twins denied that they had had
anything to do with Philip and his appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did see him under the seat asleep this
morning when we were out in the garage,&#8221; admitted
Twaddles. &#8220;I guess he didn&#8217;t wake up
till now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;ll have to walk back with you, that&#8217;s
all,&#8221; grumbled Sam. &#8220;Your father doesn&#8217;t want
a dog around when he&#8217;s thinking about business.
What is it, Bobby?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a queer looking stone,&#8221; said Bobby,
who had been pulling at Sam&#8217;s sleeve to attract
his attention. &#8220;See it down there? Slow up,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
and you will. There! Let me get out and get
it for my collection?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam slowed down the car, and looked with
interest at the spot to which Bobby pointed.
Then he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lump of coal,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;Fell
off a heavy load, I guess, on its way to the foundry.
Collecting stones, are you, Bobby?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; said Bobby. &#8220;You see I heard
about a boy who went around cracking pebbles
and stones and sometimes he found very valuable
ones. Maybe I will, too. Anyway I like
to crack &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Sam, looking at his watch. &#8220;Well,
we&#8217;ll have to hustle a little to make it by two
o&#8217;clock. Hold your hats, youngsters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam delighted to let the car out occasionally,
and for the next few minutes they whirled steadily
through a cloud of dust. Then the iron gates
of the foundry, of which Father Blossom was
the owner and where he had his office, loomed
up ahead of them, and Sam put on the brakes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming right away,&#8221; called Father Blossom,
as the car rolled past the office window, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
he was working at a roll-top desk, and stopped
before the door.</p>
<p>In just a moment he came out, buckling his
brief case as he came down the steps.</p>
<p>&#8220;They wanted to come,&#8221; said Sam apologetically,
indicating his passengers. &#8220;I told &#8217;em
they&#8217;d have to walk home, because you were
going over to Clayton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, can&#8217;t have you along this trip,&#8221; declared
Father Blossom regretfully. &#8220;Where are you
going, Sam?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam was driving further into the foundry
yard. He turned with a half-sheepish grin to
answer his employer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to drive in around the pump and
make a turn,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Meg doesn&#8217;t like to be
in the car when it&#8217;s backing, so I thought I
wouldn&#8217;t worry her.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Sam drove carefully around the piles of
iron and scraps and, making a wide detour at
the pump, drove out of the yard again. Meg
smiled her thanks. She wished she didn&#8217;t feel
that a car was likely to tip over when it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
backed, but she was sure she couldn&#8217;t help that
feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I s&#8217;pose we&#8217;ll have to get out,&#8221; murmured
Bobby, as they came to the sign-post with
a finger pointing to &#8220;Oak Hill, 2 miles,&#8221; in one
direction, and another finger reading, &#8220;Clayton,
8 miles,&#8221; pointing another way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and don&#8217;t loiter,&#8221; directed Father Blossom.
&#8220;Go straight home and tell Mother if I
can I&#8217;ll be back for supper, but not to wait for
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Philip was glad to be out of the car, and he
frisked ahead, barking and trying to tempt some
one to run a race with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;This looks valuable,&#8221; said Bobby, picking up
a pebble he found at one side of the road. &#8220;Wait
a minute, Meg, till I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>The twins watched with interest while Bobby
smashed the pebble with his hammer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it valuable?&#8221; demanded Twaddles.</p>
<p>Bobby brushed away the dust and gathered up
the fragments. It was a white pebble, and the
broken bits were white, faintly veined with yellow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if it&#8217;s very rare,&#8221; hazarded
the collector. &#8220;Anyway, I&#8217;m going to
take it and keep it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He scooped the pieces into his bag, and then
the four trotted briskly along toward home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, goodness, this is luck!&#8221; cried a hearty
voice, and an automobile that had come up behind
them stopped. It was the Oak Hill grocery-store
car, and kind, stout Mr. Hambert, one
of the clerks, was out making deliveries.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going over to Riceville,&#8221; he said, leaning
out to talk to the children. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want
to go along? Room for everybody, and I&#8217;ll have
you home by supper time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Meg, let&#8217;s,&#8221; teased Dot, who dearly
loved to go anywhere. &#8220;Mother won&#8217;t care.
Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to practice,&#8221; said Meg soberly. &#8220;But
the rest of you can go. I&#8217;ll tell Mother so she
won&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; declared Bobby. &#8220;It&#8217;s my
turn to fix up the rabbit pen. Twaddles didn&#8217;t
half do it last week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did too,&#8221; retorted Twaddles, already scrambling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
into the seat beside Mr. Hambert. &#8220;Guess
I keep those rabbits as good as you do, Bobby.
You&#8217;re always fussing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Hambert held out a hand to Dot and
pulled her into place beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he nodded kindly to Meg and
Bobby. &#8220;You won&#8217;t be sorry if you do the work
first and play afterward. Tell your mother I&#8217;ll
see these youngsters safe home by half-past five.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose Dot looked clean enough to
go to Riceville?&#8221; worried Meg, after the fashion
of older sisters, as the grocery car shot up the
road and took the turn to the right. &#8220;Like as
not they&#8217;ll go to the hotel and all the boarders
will see her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Bobby carelessly,
&#8220;Here&#8217;s the spring lot, Meg. See how muddy
the path is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The children had been following a narrow
path that ran through the grass at the side of
the road and which would presently meet the
concrete walk that marked the beginning of the
town. The &#8220;spring lot&#8221; was a marshy piece of
land that was full of springs which fed and kept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
puddles of mud moist through the dryest season.
To-day, although everywhere else the dust
was fine and white, the path along the spring lot
was oozy and soft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s coming?&#8221; said Meg, looking up the
road suddenly. &#8220;Look, Bobby, isn&#8217;t that Tim
Roon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby glanced up from his favorite occupation
of cracking stones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Wonder where he&#8217;s
going?&#8221;</p>
<p>His hands in his pockets, his cap on the back
of his head, Tim Roon came toward them, whistling
loudly. When he was near enough to see
the two children, he stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, smarties!&#8221; was his greeting. &#8220;How&#8217;s
teacher&#8217;s pet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not teacher&#8217;s pet,&#8221; retorted Bobby indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody said you were,&#8221; answered Tim
Roon. &#8220;Can&#8217;t a person speak to your sister,
without you taking it all on yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby flushed angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t speak to my sister unless you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
can talk right,&#8221; he said rapidly. &#8220;Come on,
Meg, call Philip, and we&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dog was hunting in the marsh and came
bounding out at Meg&#8217;s first call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a mutt.&#8221; Tim Roon summed up poor
Philip disagreeably. &#8220;You ought to see the dog
my father&#8217;s got. What&#8217;s your hurry, anyway?
You can&#8217;t go till I&#8217;m ready to let you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood directly in the path, on the only dry
spot. If Meg or Bobby tried to go around him,
they must step into thick, black mud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teacher&#8217;s pet!&#8221; mocked Tim Roon, pointing
a dirty forefinger at Meg. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t know
she had to tell she whispered! But I notice you
could laugh at Charlie Black when he sat on the
candy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg did not see what that had to do with her
whispering, and perhaps Tim Roon couldn&#8217;t
have told either. He was merely doing his best
to be unkind and unpleasant, and succeeding as
well as such ill-natured folk usually do.</p>
<p>&#8220;You get out of the way, Tim Roon!&#8221; cried
Bobby. &#8220;Go ahead, Meg, I&#8217;ll punch him if he
touches you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>Tim was older and larger than Bobby, but
the latter had no intention of allowing him to
annoy his sister.</p>
<p>Meg tried to push her way past the short,
sturdy body of Tim, who blocked her path. A
quick twist of a vicious, sharp, little elbow
jostled her into the mud, and she stepped in over
one of her low shoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will, will you,&#8221; snarled Bobby, angrier
than he had ever been in his life. &#8220;You just
wait&ndash;&ndash;knocking a girl like that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim squared off, as he had seen fighters in
pictures do, and Bobby lowered his head for a
rush. But Philip, who had been an interested
spectator, decided that the time had come for
him to be of use. With a sharp bark, he lunged
straight for Tim&#8217;s legs, his sharp, even teeth
showing on either side of his red tongue. Tim
saw him coming, jumped to avoid him, lost his
footing, and slipped. He fell into the thickest
part of the mud, his foot doubled under him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run, Meg!&#8221; shouted Bobby, who wisely decided
that it was the better part of valor to take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
advantage of Tim&#8217;s plight. &#8220;Come, Philip, run!
run!&#8221;</p>
<p>Pell-mell, the stones clattering in the bag
Bobby still clutched, Philip racing ahead and
barking like a mad dog, the two children ran
down the road and did not stop till they reached
the broad band of cement walk where the east
boundaries of Oak Hill were drawn.</p>
<p>Then they stopped and looked back, Philip
panting and growling a little as if he only
wanted a word to go back and repeat his good
work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>A HARD LESSON</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;My, I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;s mad!&#8221; said Bobby.
Tim was standing in the mud, trying
to scrape some of it off his clothes. His cap was
gone and great patches of mud clung to his face
and hair. He was a distressed looking object
indeed. While they watched, he glanced up and
saw them standing there. He shook a fist at
Bobby, and began to limp slowly off down the
road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose he is hurt?&#8221; asked Meg
anxiously. &#8220;Maybe he ought to go to see Doctor
Maynard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t hurt,&#8221; Bobby assured her confidently.
&#8220;That mud is as soft as&ndash;&ndash;as anything!
Wasn&#8217;t Philip fine to think of scaring him like
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, Philip had an extra good supper that
night, after Bobby and Meg had told Mother
and Norah all about the help he had given them,
and the twins, when they came in from their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
drive, were filled with admiration for such an
intelligent dog.</p>
<p>&#8220;My practicing&#8217;s all done,&#8221; announced Meg
happily. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind it so much now, &#8217;cause
I want to be ready to play assembly marches
when I&#8217;m in the third grade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to see how rabbit pens ought to
look,&#8221; Bobby told Twaddles confidentially, &#8220;just
go out and see those I fixed this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; sniffed Twaddles with withering indifference,
&#8220;I guess the rabbits don&#8217;t know
they&#8217;re any better off!&#8221;</p>
<p>The first week of school went very smoothly,
and both Bobby and Meg began to look forward
to their reports at the end of the month. These
reports were immensely important, according to
Bobby, who was, of course, experienced in such
matters.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Bert Figger gets eight in spelling, his
father&#8217;s going to give him fifty cents,&#8221; Bobby
told Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get nine in &#8217;rithmetic, I know you
will,&#8221; said Meg admiringly. &#8220;You&#8217;re awfully
good in that, Bobby.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think I am,&#8221; agreed Bobby. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
missed one so far. Every answer I&#8217;ve worked
out has been right.&#8221;</p>
<p>He repeated this assertion at the supper table
that night, and Father Blossom shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure of that nine,&#8221; he said warningly.
&#8220;The work is going to get harder the
further you go, you know. Trying for a nine
is all right, but I don&#8217;t like to hear you speak
as though you didn&#8217;t have to make any effort to
reach it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning in school Miss Mason had
something interesting to show her first grade
pupils. It was a very beautifully illustrated
book of verses for children. The poems were
written by famous poets, and each poet had
signed his name to his own verse. The pictures
were in colors and had been painted by well-known
artists, who had signed their work with
a pen after the pictures had been printed. So
it was really a picture book, a poem book, and
an autograph album all in one.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are only three like it in the world,&#8221;
explained Miss Mason. &#8220;They were raffled off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
at a fair for a children&#8217;s hospital, and a friend
of mine, one of the artists, won a copy. She sent
it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Mason said the second grade might examine
the book at recess or at noon, because they
had been busy with their writing lesson while
she was showing it to the younger children.
Then, while the first grade was set to work to
make a page of &#8220;S&#8217;s,&#8221; Miss Mason called the
second grade to order for their arithmetic lesson.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not need pencils and paper this
morning,&#8221; she announced. &#8220;We are going to
have a little mental arithmetic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie Black groaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; said the teacher sharply. &#8220;Tim
Roon, are you chewing gum again? Come and
put it in the waste basket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim gulped hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve swallowed it,&#8221; he declared.</p>
<p>Miss Mason frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope that some day you will do as I tell
you,&#8221; she said impatiently. &#8220;Now ready. Robert
Blossom, if I go down to Mr. Dryburg&#8217;s shop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
and buy two yards of percale at sixteen cents a
yard, how much must I pay?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby hastily counted on his fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty-two cents,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand up straight,&#8221; commanded Miss Mason.
&#8220;And if I buy three yards of braid at ten cents a
yard, how much will that be?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg looked up from her writing lesson to
watch Bobby&#8217;s hands, though she knew that if
Miss Mason saw her she would be scolded severely.
He held them behind him and his fingers
fairly galloped as he used them for an adding
machine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty cents for braid,&#8221; stammered Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I give Mr. Dryburg a dollar bill, how
much change shall I have?&#8221; asked Miss Mason,
switching from multiplication to subtraction so
quickly that the startled Bobby lost his count.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; urged the teacher. &#8220;What are you
doing with your hands, Robert? Bring them
out where I can see them. Now then, how much
change is coming to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby was hopelessly bewildered now, and he
had forgotten the cost of both percale and braid.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
He managed to stutter, &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t know,&#8221; and
sat down thankfully.</p>
<p>Tim Roon scraped his feet noisily, intending
to annoy Bobby, but unfortunately he drew the
attention of Miss Mason to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand up, Tim,&#8221; she commanded sharply.
&#8220;How much change should I have from that dollar
bill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; muttered Tim.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much did the braid cost?&#8221; demanded
Miss Mason.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve forgotten,&#8221; said Tim.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you didn&#8217;t listen,&#8221; retorted Miss
Mason. &#8220;Sit down. If this class can&#8217;t do any
better with a simple test like this, I&#8217;m afraid
you&#8217;ll make a poor showing with your cards this
month. Marion Green, perhaps you can tell me
how much change I should have?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion Green was a little girl ordinarily very
good in arithmetic. But she was frightened now
and plainly showed it. She wouldn&#8217;t even get
out of her seat and try to answer.</p>
<p>Palmer Davis was no better, and Hester Scott
frankly burst into tears when called upon. By
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
this time most of the class had forgotten what
the problem was, but Miss Mason refused to
repeat it. She said they should be able to remember
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Bertrand?&#8221; Miss Mason spoke to
Bertrand Ashe, a rather dull boy, and one who
habitually made mistakes when sent to the blackboard
to work out examples.</p>
<p>Bertrand stood up, his sleepy eyes fixed earnestly
on his teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;The percale and the braid came to sixty-two
cents altogether,&#8221; he announced, &#8220;so if you gave
Mr. Dryburg a dollar, you would have thirty-eight
cents in change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bertrand sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Miss Mason. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I have
one pupil who knows how to use his brain. Some
of those who might have had eight on their cards
this month needn&#8217;t be surprised to find a six.
Robert, how much is seven times six?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; muttered Bobby ungraciously.</p>
<p>He did know, but he was miffed to think he
had missed a problem that Bertrand Ashe had
been able to solve.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t the kind of spirit to show,&#8221; said
Miss Mason sharply. &#8220;Instead of being resentful,
you should resolve to keep your head next
time. Nothing in the world but panic made you
miss that question, Robert. Now go to the board
and take the example I read you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby sat still, his feet locked rebelliously in
the iron framework of his desk.</p>
<p>Miss Mason took no notice of him for a moment,
sending several others to the board, among
them Tim Roon and Charlie Black. Then she
came down the aisle to Bobby&#8217;s desk, a piece of
chalk in her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to the board, Robert,&#8221; she said quietly,
putting the chalk into his unwilling fingers and
closing them around it with a warm friendly
pressure of her own strong, slim fingers.</p>
<p>Bobby was suddenly ready to go, though not
ready yet to show that he was ashamed of the
way he had acted. Miss Mason read aloud the
problem, and those at the board began their
figuring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Margaret!&#8221; Miss Mason spoke so suddenly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
that Meg jumped. &#8220;Are you interested in this
lesson? Have you finished your page?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg blushed brightly and bent over her copy
book. She had made only seven letters, but then
she had been anxious lest Bobby get one of his
&#8220;stubborn fits,&#8221; as Norah called them, when no
one but Father Blossom could persuade him to
change his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Miss Mason is as mean as can be!&#8221;
thought Meg to herself, carefully tracing the
outline of a graceful &#8220;S.&#8221; &#8220;She says cross things
all the time. I wonder is she old?&#8221;</p>
<p>Old people had a right to be cross, Meg considered.
Miss Mason didn&#8217;t look old&ndash;&ndash;she had
hair as yellow as Meg&#8217;s own, and big brown eyes.
And she wore pretty dresses. Meg was so interested
in studying Miss Mason that the recess
bell rang before she had finished her copy-book
page.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE SPOILED BOOK</h3>
</div>
<p>The children put their books away thankfully
and trooped out into the yard. Miss
Mason, after putting up every window, as was
her custom, went across the hall to the teachers&#8217;
room.</p>
<p>Tim Roon was so busy dusting off the top of
his desk and fastening down his papers so that
the wind would not blow them away that he was
the last pupil left in the room when Miss Mason
went out, closing the door behind her. Tim
waited till he was sure she was not coming back,
then tiptoed hastily up to her desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show her!&#8221; he muttered, tumbling books
and papers about till he found what he wanted.</p>
<p>It was the illustrated and autographed book
of verses. And now if any one had been there
to see Tim they would have been astonished at
what he did next. Reaching down into a kind
of cabinet that formed the lower part of Miss
Mason&#8217;s desk, Tim brought up a tall bottle of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
ink from which the desk inkwells were filled.
He took the stopper out and opened the book.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you doing?&#8221; asked a voice at his elbow.</p>
<p>Tim&#8217;s conscience was guilty enough, dear
knows, so it was no wonder that he jumped. A
thick stream of ink spurted out and ran down
the crevice of the binding of the book. Tim
closed it quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, Charlie Black! you scared me,&#8221; Tim
said, relieved to find that the voice belonged to
his chum. &#8220;What am I doing? You just watch
me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim opened the book again and poured out
more ink. Then he closed it and pressed down
hard on the covers. He did this several times,
each inking making an ugly, blurry figure that
completely ruined two or three pages of the
book.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that for?&#8221; demanded Charlie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think I&#8217;m going to be nagged every day in
the week and never do a thing about it?&#8221; growled
Tim. &#8220;Maybe when she finds her precious book
marked up she&#8217;ll begin to understand that there&#8217;s
some one who won&#8217;t stand for everything.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s she going to know you did it?&#8221; asked
Charlie Black, watching the ink seep into a fine
illustration as Tim slowly poured more out.</p>
<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t know if I can help it,&#8221; grinned that
bad boy. &#8220;And if I catch you opening your
mouth&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; promised Charlie hastily. &#8220;Honest,
I won&#8217;t say a word, Tim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not,&#8221; warned Tim darkly. &#8220;Let
me ever find out you as much as whispered you
saw me and I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know what I won&#8217;t
do to you!&#8221;</p>
<p>This vague threat was sufficiently terrifying
to insure obedience from Charlie, who knew
from experience that Tim could be both relentless
and cruel. There was little danger that he
would ever betray his chum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I guess that&#8217;s finished,&#8221; announced Tim
with satisfaction, closing the once lovely book.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t look at me when she takes it out after
recess to show the class. Wait till I put back
these papers where they were. There now, let&#8217;s
go downstairs and come up with the others when
the bell rings.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>When the bell rang and the children came
upstairs, they found a member of the school committee
sitting on the platform beside Miss Mason&#8217;s
desk, and the teacher announced that they
would have a reading lesson for the first and
second grades in place of the usual work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will show you the book I promised to let
the second grade see, directly after the noon
period,&#8221; said Miss Mason. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I couldn&#8217;t
be here this recess, but we had an important conference.
Now, Margaret, you may read the first
paragraph of the third lesson.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rufus Hornbeck was the name of the committeeman,
and all the children who had been
to school before knew him as the head of the
school committee and a man who could, if he
wished, scold even Mr. Carter, the primary and
grammar school principal. Some of the boys
said that &#8220;old Hornbeck,&#8221; as they disrespectfully
called him, had the right to tell Mr. Fredericks,
the high-school principal, what to do. But the
high-school was too far away for the majority of
the boys to think about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come up here on the platform, and face the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
class,&#8221; said Mr. Hornbeck to Meg. &#8220;Read
clearly now, and let your classmates enjoy the
story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor Meg was very shy as she went up to the
platform, for reading aloud was an ordeal for
her, though at home she always had her &#8220;nose in
a book,&#8221; as Norah said. She reached the platform,
grasped her reading book tightly in both
hands, and began to read hurriedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough,&#8221; announced Miss Mason, as
Meg came to the end of a long paragraph.</p>
<p>Meg closed her book, stepped to one side to
avoid the waste basket, and put her foot squarely
into Mr. Hornbeck&#8217;s high silk hat which he had
placed carefully on the floor beside his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut! tut!&#8221; said Mr. Hornbeck reprovingly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so clumsy, child. Don&#8217;t kick&ndash;&ndash;lift
your foot out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg was crimson with embarrassment, and
the class was snickering in spite of Miss
Mason&#8217;s frown. Meg was glad to escape to her
seat, and the committeeman moved his hat
further back before the next unlucky reader
came to the platform.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>It did seem as though the noon bell would
never ring, but at quarter of twelve it did, and
Meg and Bobby hurried home to lunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do all morning?&#8221; asked Meg
of the twins, who as usual were waiting for them
at the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Played school,&#8221; answered Dot.</p>
<p>That was the usual answer. The twins never
tired of playing school, and whatever Meg and
Bobby told them one day they were pretty sure
to &#8220;pretend&#8221; the next. Always and always, too,
they wished that they might go to &#8220;regular&#8221;
school.</p>
<p>That afternoon, as soon as she had given the
first grade pupils seat work to keep them busy,
Miss Mason remembered her promise to show
the higher class her book. Tim Roon, who had
been secretly relieved that Mr. Hornbeck&#8217;s visit
had delayed the discovery of his trick, now began
to be uneasy. He flashed a warning look at
Charlie Black as Miss Mason fumbled with the
papers that covered the book.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pass it down the aisle,&#8221; said Miss Mason,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
drawing out the book. &#8220;Now, Ellen, this first
picture was drawn by an artist named&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen Glover looked up startled. Miss Mason&#8217;s
voice had stopped so suddenly when she
opened her book that the effect was as if some
one had closed a door sharply while some one
else was speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her face was just as white,&#8221; Meg afterward
told her mother, &#8220;and then it got red and her eyes
snapped like&ndash;&ndash;like anything!&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed Miss Mason&#8217;s eyes were snapping fire.
Tim Roon for the first time in his life was
actually afraid of his teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some vandal has destroyed this beautiful
book,&#8221; said Miss Mason, speaking coldly and
slowly. &#8220;It was almost priceless. I want each
one of you to come up to the desk and see how
it has been ruined. First grade, put away your
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sudden shiver of excitement went over the
room. No one had ever seen Miss Mason so
angry before. And yet she was very quiet and
still about it. Aisle by aisle, she made them
come up and look at the book, insisting that each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
child take it in his hands and examine the spots
of ink. When the last pupil had returned to his
seat she spoke again.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was done during recess,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
did not leave the room this noon. If any one in
this class was in the room at recess this morning,
raise his hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not one hand went up.</p>
<p>Miss Mason sighed impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you are determined to make it hard for
me,&#8221; she commented. &#8220;Very well, if we do no
work this afternoon, we&#8217;ll get to the bottom of
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then beginning with the girls, she asked each
one if she had been in the room during recess
time. As it happened not a girl had entered the
room between the bells. An interesting game of
tag had taken the attention of both grades in the
girls&#8217; half of the school yard.</p>
<p>Then Miss Mason began with the boys. Each
one denied that he had been in the room till she
reached Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I was up here,&#8221; he admitted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you raise your hand?&#8221; snapped
Miss Mason. &#8220;What were you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I came up to get my ball. I had left it in
my desk,&#8221; answered Bobby.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for him, he looked confused
and cross, and Miss Mason had some grounds
for thinking he might know more than he cared
to tell.</p>
<p>&#8220;When were you up here?&#8221; she persisted.</p>
<p>Tim Roon listened eagerly for Bobby&#8217;s reply.
He was beginning to wonder if he had been seen
leaving the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;About three minutes before the bell rang,&#8221;
said Bobby defiantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak to me like that,&#8221; commanded
Miss Mason. &#8220;Do you know how the ink got
on this book, Robert?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby was silent. Meg looked worried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Robert, do you hear me? I am asking you
if you know how this book was defaced?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby&#8217;s blue eyes shot out a few sparks equal
to those in Miss Mason&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I don&#8217;t!&#8221; he retorted, not at all
respectfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>Bobby had been taught to love books at home
and to handle them carefully. He was hurt and
astonished that any one should think he would
deliberately ruin a beautiful book, and he forgot
that Miss Mason couldn&#8217;t know him as well as
Father and Mother Blossom did. They would
never suspect him of harming a book.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this is your idea of getting even for the
arithmetic lesson this morning, all I can say is
that you&#8217;ve chosen a very underhanded method,&#8221;
declared Miss Mason, evidently determined to
believe the worst.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never touched the book,&#8221; insisted Bobby
hotly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>BOBBY IN TROUBLE</h3>
</div>
<p>Miss Mason glanced at him oddly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Then she proceeded to question the other boys.
Palmer Davis admitted that he had been in the
room during recess, to get a pencil, he said. And
Henry Graham, a boy in the first grade, whispered
shakily that he had come back for an apple
he had left in his desk. Miss Mason was
cross-examining Wilbert Peters, another boy, when
the door was suddenly pushed open and an odd
procession entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, for pity&#8217;s sake!&#8221; ejaculated Meg aloud,
then slapped a hasty hand to her mouth.</p>
<p>Philip, his tail wagging ingratiatingly, came
first, carrying Totty-Fay in his mouth. Back of
him marched the twins, Twaddles&#8217; face shining
with soap and water he had evidently applied
himself, for it had dried in streaks, and Dot in a
frock so stiffly starched that each separate ruffle
stood out around her like a small platform.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; grinned Twaddles, embarrassed now
that he found so many eyes fixed on him.</p>
<p>Miss Mason looked surprised.</p>
<p>Philip marched up to the platform and put
down the doll. Then he sat down, panting, his
tail wagging furiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&ndash;&ndash;we want to go to school, too,&#8221; explained
Dot, speaking to Miss Mason, &#8220;so we came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; admitted the teacher. &#8220;You&#8217;re not old
enough to come to school yet. Whose children
are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Miss Mason,&#8221; Meg stood up bravely,
&#8220;they&#8217;re my brother and sister, Twaddles and
Dot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dorothy, I suppose,&#8221; amended Miss Mason,
who could never bear to use a nickname, no matter
how pretty. &#8220;But where on earth did a child
get the name of Twaddles?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His right name is Arthur Gifford Blossom,&#8221;
explained Meg timidly.</p>
<p>The twins were sitting down comfortably on
the edge of the platform and studying the room
with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Margaret, I think you will have to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
take them home,&#8221; said Miss Mason, not unkindly.
&#8220;It lacks only fifteen minutes of dismissal
time, anyway. I shall let the girls go at
half-past three, but the boys will have to remain
till we get this matter of the defaced book
straightened out. Go and get your hat and coat,
Margaret.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg went to the cloak room for her hat and
coat and came back to find Miss Mason saying
good-by to the twins.</p>
<p>&#8220;And when you are six years old we&#8217;ll be very
glad to have you come to school,&#8221; she told them.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget the doll&ndash;&ndash;all right, now you&#8217;re
ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>She held open the door for Philip, and even
patted him on the head as he trotted through.
The irrepressible twins, who had enjoyed their
visit and were sorry to have it over so soon,
turned as they were following Meg out of the
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, Bobby,&#8221; they chorused.</p>
<p>Poor Bobby blushed violently, and the other
children laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t talk like that,&#8221; Meg reproved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
them as she piloted them down the hall. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t holler out loud in school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it nice?&#8221; said Dot admiringly. &#8220;Oh,
Meg, what&#8217;s this room?&#8221;</p>
<p>She had darted to the open door of the assembly
hall and was peering in at the rows and
rows of empty seats.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; urged Meg. &#8220;Don&#8217;t snoop around
like that, Dot. I&#8217;ll bet Bobby is mad &#8217;cause you
made everybody laugh at him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twon&#8217;t hurt him,&#8221; declared Twaddles impishly.
&#8220;Who&#8217;s that man in there, Meg?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg glanced hurriedly into the office they
were passing. The door was partly closed, but
she could see a man speaking to Miss Wright.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the principal, Mr. Carter,&#8221; whispered
Meg, her teeth almost chattering with fright.
&#8220;I hope Miss Mason doesn&#8217;t tell him about her
book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Wright had heard the whispering and
came to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Meg,&#8221; she said pleasantly, &#8220;aren&#8217;t you
going home early? And are these new scholars?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the twins,&#8221; stammered Meg desperately.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
&#8220;They would come, and Miss Mason says I must
take them home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Carter, who had come up behind Miss
Wright, laughed. He had clear, kind eyes behind
his glasses, and he was much younger than
Meg had supposed him to be. The other children
had talked to her so much of how terrible
the principal was when he had a bad boy before
him that she had really pictured an ogre, with
gray hair and a terrible hooked nose and a loud,
fierce voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of children having to be driven
to school,&#8221; said Mr. Carter, still smiling, &#8220;but
this is the first time I ever knew that they had to
be taken home to prevent them from learning.
Never mind, youngsters, your school days are
coming. And when you do come to Oak Hill
School, you come and see me the very first day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The twins were too shy to do more than nod,
and Meg hurried them out of the building,
Philip having already pushed the door open and
gone, before they should attract any more attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;What ever put it into your head to come?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
she scolded, leading the way toward home.
&#8220;Does Mother know it?&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time Twaddles appeared to be
somewhat confused.</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t know it exactly,&#8221; he admitted.
&#8220;We just said we were going out.&#8221;</p>
<p>And indeed Mother Blossom was very much
surprised when Meg walked into the sitting
room followed by the twins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Bobby?&#8221; asked Mother Blossom,
looking up from her sewing. &#8220;And you are
early, dear. Is anything wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing much,&#8221; said Meg, with a severe
glance at the culprits, &#8220;&#8217;cept the children came
to school and brought the dog and Totty-Fay,
and Bobby has to stay in because Miss Mason
says he spilt ink all over her book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course there was an exciting half-hour
after that, with the twins trying to show their
side of the case and Mother Blossom half laughing
and half scolding over their performance.
Meg had also to tell everything that had happened
in connection with the book, and Mother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
Blossom and the twins were all sure that Bobby
had had absolutely nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Course he didn&#8217;t!&#8221; said Meg vehemently.
&#8220;I know he was mad about missing the arithmetic
lesson, but he wouldn&#8217;t go and spatter ink
on a book. And it was such a lovely book,
Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were still talking when Bobby came in,
looking hot and tired and very cross.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long did she keep you in?&#8221; asked Meg,
as he flung his cap into the corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;An hour,&#8221; returned Bobby. &#8220;She let all the
boys go but six of us at four o&#8217;clock, and she
says one of us six must have done it. And they
all say it&#8217;s me. But I didn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was looking at Mother Blossom, and she
smiled back at him, her own, sunny, cheerful
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know you didn&#8217;t, dear,&#8221; she declared
proudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;She sent you a note, Mother,&#8221; said Bobby,
fishing around in his pocket and bringing out
a crumpled, rather soiled little envelope. &#8220;My,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
I was mad! She doesn&#8217;t believe a word I say.
I wish I had spoiled her old book!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t it been the meanest day!&#8221; sighed Meg.
&#8220;I hate school!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom folded the note she had been
reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dot and Twaddles, Sam is just backing out
the car to go after Daddy,&#8221; she said to the twins.
&#8220;Run along, and you may go with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The twins scampered off, and then she turned
to Meg and Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Mason evidently thinks you destroyed
the book, Bobby,&#8221; sighed Mother Blossom, &#8220;but
as it can not be positively proved, you are to go
to school as usual. I am sorrier than words can
tell you that this has happened. But, dearie,
I&#8217;m afraid you are a bit to blame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; cried the astonished Bobby. &#8220;Why,
Mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, think how you acted over the arithmetic
lesson,&#8221; Mother Blossom reminded him.
&#8220;You know Daddy and I have talked to you
about this before, Bobby. You are not a very
good loser, and the boy who can&#8217;t lose and keep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
his temper will never be a good sportsman. Suppose
Daddy got mad and &#8216;talked back&#8217; whenever
things didn&#8217;t go to suit him at the foundry!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom put an arm around Bobby
and drew him closer to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you had spoken to Daddy or to me
as you did to Miss Mason,&#8221; she went on, smoothing
back his hair, &#8220;I think you know what you
would be asked to do&ndash;&ndash;what you would want to
do, in fact. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pologize,&#8221; muttered Bobby shamefacedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mother Blossom. &#8220;And I want
you to apologize to Miss Mason for being discourteous.
Never mind if she does think you
spoiled the book. As long as you know and we
know you didn&#8217;t, that really doesn&#8217;t matter very
much; and you&#8217;ll feel so much better if you do
what is right. The boy who did ruin the book
will be found out some day. Such things always
come to light.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>SENT TO THE OFFICE</h3>
</div>
<p>The next morning Bobby trudged off to
school with Meg feeling, for the first time
in his life, that he would rather do anything
except go to school.</p>
<p>&#8220;You stay out and play,&#8221; he directed Meg
when they reached the yard. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go up and
see Miss Mason.&#8221;</p>
<p>He found the teacher at her desk. She looked
neat and cool and self-possessed, and Bobby did
not have any of those qualities at that moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&ndash;&ndash;I acted like that&ndash;&ndash;yesterday at
&#8217;rithmetic,&#8221; faltered Bobby jerkily. &#8220;My mother
says I musn&#8217;t be a poor loser.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Robert, we&#8217;ll overlook that,&#8221; rejoined
Miss Mason graciously. &#8220;I could see
you were piqued because you failed. But is that
all you have to tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby stared at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you nothing to say about the book?&#8221;
urged Miss Mason.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do it,&#8221; insisted Bobby. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
think I would lie, do you&ndash;&ndash;not really?&#8221; he
asked, amazed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to think,&#8221; sighed Miss
Mason. &#8220;I am heartily sorry I ever brought
the book to school. And, Robert, I thought it
my duty to speak to Mr. Carter about this. You
are to go to the office direct from assembly without
coming back here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor Bobby came as near to fainting as a boy
ever does. Mr. Carter! He shared all the awe
and fear of the other boys for the principal of
whom little was known, he spending most of his
time at the grammar school. Evidently Miss
Mason must think him very bad indeed if she
had sent for Mr. Carter.</p>
<p>All through assembly Bobby&#8217;s thoughts were
on the coming interview, and though he usually
loved to sing the opening song, this morning he
did not sing a note. He looked so solemn and
serious that Tim Roon, watching him, decided
his father must have whipped him.</p>
<p>The exercises were over too soon for Bobby,
who would have had them last the rest of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
day if he had been consulted, and the long lines
of marching children went back to their classrooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder where Bobby is,&#8221; thought Meg
uneasily, when Miss Mason&#8217;s classes had rustled
into place and Bobby&#8217;s seat was still vacant.</p>
<p>Bobby, if she had known it, was at that moment
making his reluctant way to the office. Just
the mere letters printed on the door were enough
to make his heart sink down into his shoes, and,
as he told his mother afterward, he wished he
could &#8220;die on the little mat you&#8217;re supposed to
wipe your feet on.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wiped his feet carefully, took a last desperate
look up and down the empty hall, and
tapped on the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; called a deep, pleasant voice, not
at all the kind of voice you would expect a stern,
cross principal to use.</p>
<p>Bobby opened the door and went in. Mr.
Carter was writing at Miss Wright&#8217;s desk and
there was no one else in the room. Bobby knew
the principal by sight, for he had seen him once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
or twice in the corridors. It seemed that Mr.
Carter also knew the pupils.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Bobby,&#8221; he said cheerfully. &#8220;You are
Bobby Blossom, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby nodded miserably. He was thankful
for the &#8220;Bobby,&#8221; for he detested the unfamiliar
&#8220;Robert&#8221; Miss Mason invariably used.</p>
<p>Mr. Carter took off his glasses and laid them
on the desk. He turned his chair slightly to face
another chair drawn up at the side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come sit down, Bobby, and don&#8217;t be afraid,&#8221;
he said quietly. &#8220;I want you to tell me what
happened in class yesterday, and why Miss Mason
should think that you defaced her book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby slid timidly into the chair and began
to answer Mr. Carter&#8217;s quick questions. And then
a strange thing happened. Bobby forgot to be
afraid. As he told about the arithmetic lesson,
where he had been a &#8220;poor loser,&#8221; and about the
beautiful book that had been destroyed, and explained
why he went back to the room at recess
time, he forgot that he was speaking to the principal.
He stood up straight beside the desk and
talked to Mr. Carter as he would to Daddy Blossom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
And the principal&#8217;s kind, earnest eyes, his
ready smile, and deep, pleasant voice, all told
Bobby that he was speaking to a friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I didn&#8217;t touch the book, honest I
didn&#8217;t,&#8221; finished Bobby.</p>
<p>Mr. Carter put a big, firm hand over the little
one resting on his desk top.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I believe you,&#8221; he said earnestly.
&#8220;Some day we&#8217;ll find the boy who did it, never
fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Miss Mason thinks&ndash;&ndash;she thinks I did it,&#8221;
protested Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see Miss Mason,&#8221; promised Mr. Carter
briefly. &#8220;The thing for you to do is to forget
this and go on as though nothing had happened.
You&#8217;ll find Miss Mason fair-minded and ready
to own a mistake has been made when once she
is convinced. As long as you know you didn&#8217;t
do it you have absolutely nothing to worry
about.&#8221;</p>
<p>The principal put on his glasses and stood up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time you come to see me, let&#8217;s hope we
have something pleasanter to discuss,&#8221; he said
smilingly, holding out his hand to Bobby. &#8220;By
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
the way, didn&#8217;t I see a little sister of yours yesterday
and two other young people rather anxious
to go to school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was Meg,&#8221; Bobby informed him. &#8220;She
had to take the twins home. They&#8217;re crazy to
come to school.&#8221; Then he backed out of the
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was just as nice!&#8221; Bobby kept saying over
and over to himself on his way upstairs. &#8220;Just
as nice! And he doesn&#8217;t b&#8217;lieve I hurt the
book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim Roon glanced at Bobby curiously as he
came quietly into the room and took his seat.
The class was having a reading lesson, and Tim
could keep his book open and pretend to be very
busy while he did several other things. He had
not known that Miss Mason would make such a
&#8220;fuss,&#8221; as Tim called it, over the book, and he
was mean enough to be glad that Bobby was
getting all the punishment. Tim had a wholesome
fear of Mr. Carter, having met the principal
on several occasions when his bent for mischief
had brought Miss Mason&#8217;s wrath down on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
him. He wondered what Mr. Carter had said
to Bobby.</p>
<p>The weather was clear and crisp now, and the
grammar and high-school boys could talk of
nothing but football. The primary grades, of
course, were considered too little to have a team,
but nevertheless they knew a good deal about
the game and secretly thought they had just as
fine players among them as the older boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go round and watch &#8217;em practice,&#8221; suggested
Palmer Davis to Bobby after school, the
afternoon of the day he had seen Mr. Carter.
&#8220;Meg will tell your mother. Won&#8217;t you, Meg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; agreed Meg sunnily. &#8220;Go
on, Bobby, she won&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back by five,&#8221; called Bobby after her.</p>
<p>Meg wanted to see the football teams practice,
but she was attending to her music very
diligently and practiced her hour after school
faithfully. She meant to be able to play a march
for assembly as soon as she was asked.</p>
<p>Bertrand Ashe joined Palmer and Bobby at
the corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop at my house a minute,&#8221; he urged, &#8220;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
I&#8217;ll get my football. We can have a little
game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bertrand had a cousin at boarding school who
always sent him the nicest presents for Christmas.
He had a knack of knowing what a boy
wanted, and this football was a gift from him.</p>
<p>The football under Bertrand&#8217;s arm, the three
boys walked on to the large vacant lot back of
the grammar-high-school building, which was
used by the teams as a football field.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get some more of the fellows,&#8221; directed Palmer.
&#8220;My, it&#8217;s kind of muddy, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The field was a little soft, but the two teams
were out practicing, and a crowd of enthusiastic
followers, in small groups about the lot,
were watching them. Palmer, who was a leader
among the younger boys, succeeded in rounding
up more of their class to complete his team,
among them Tim Roon and his inseparable
friend, Charlie Black.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on over in this corner,&#8221; said Palmer,
beckoning them to follow him. &#8220;Old Hornbeck&#8217;s
down to watch the high-school squad, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
like as not he&#8217;ll order us off if he sees us. Those
high-school boys think they own the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a ruling, as Palmer knew, that the
smaller boys should keep off the field while the
others were playing football. The rule was
made to keep them from getting in the way and
possibly hurt. But the primary lads were sure
they were being treated unfairly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Line up,&#8221; ordered Palmer, trying to read a
crumpled paper he had taken from his pocket.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s a signal I copied for us to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys had only a hazy notion of the way
a real game of football was played, but they kept
their eyes desperately on the ball. They had no
team to play against, as Palmer said it was hard
enough to get boys for one team, let alone two,
but they had often had great fun knocking the
ball around among their own eleven.</p>
<p>&#8220;Six-ten-nine-nought,&#8221; read Palmer.</p>
<p>He dashed forward, Bobby after him. Together
they fell on the ball and rolled over.
Then Bobby rose with it tucked neatly under his
arm, and began to run. Tim Roon and Charlie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
Black tried to head him off, slipped, and tripped
him.</p>
<p>Bobby had fallen on the ball and he meant to
keep it under him. He managed to shake off
Charlie Black and half rose, watching his
chance to run. Just as he was ready for a dash,
a stout, heavy shoe struck him in the side and
knocked him down again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Foul!&#8221; shrieked Bertrand excitedly. &#8220;Tim
Roon, you&#8217;re a cheat!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby struggled to his feet, blind with anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he sputtered, and rushed at
Tim fiercely.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>OLD HORNBECK&#8217;S PICTURE</h3>
</div>
<p>Tim met Bobby half way, and they grappled.
The other boys closed in around them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pound him good, Bobby!&#8221; advised Palmer
excitedly. &#8220;The sneak! Kicking a player like
that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit on his head,&#8221; squeaked Bertrand in a
funny little voice excitement always gave him.
&#8220;Sit on his head, the big coward!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby did not even hear these. He was hitting
wherever he could, and grunting like a
small pig as Tim rained blows upon him. Tim
was so much older and stronger that all the
advantage was on his side. Charlie Black was
hovering around the outside of the circle, not
daring to say anything for Tim, but hoping his
chum would win.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hornbeck!&#8221; suddenly cried Charlie in wild
alarm. &#8220;Hey, fellows, here comes old Hornbeck.
If he catches us&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie never finished his sentence, but took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
to his heels, followed by the rest of the boys.
Only Tim and Bobby, rolling over and over on
the ground, had not heard the warning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quit this this instant, I tell you!&#8221; roared a
hard voice, and some one grasped Bobby by his
collar, jerking him to his feet. &#8220;Fighting like
two wildcats! What do you mean by such performances
on the school grounds?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Mr. Hornbeck, and he had Bobby in
one hand and Tim in the other, and as he spoke
he shook each boy violently.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you call it you&#8217;re doing?&#8221; he roared
again.</p>
<p>Tim ran out an impudent tongue, but said
nothing. The committeeman&#8217;s eyes under his
high silk hat glared at Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were just playing football,&#8221; stammered
Bobby hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Football!&#8221; cried Mr. Hornbeck, giving each
of them a tremendous shake. &#8220;Football! You
young imps! Don&#8217;t tell me you don&#8217;t know of
the rule that primary-grade boys are to stay off
the field during football practice. If I ever
catch you around here again I&#8217;ll have you up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
before Mr. Carter. He&#8217;ll teach you to remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still retaining his grip on their collars, Mr.
Hornbeck marched them across the lot to the
street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now scoot,&#8221; he ordered.</p>
<p>They needed no second command. Tim fled
up the street and Bobby ran down, each as fast
as he could go.</p>
<p>&#8220;My stars and stripes!&#8221; ejaculated Sam Layton,
meeting Bobby as the boy came running in
the driveway, &#8220;is that what they do to you at
school? Learning must be rather hard work.&#8221;</p>
<p>No wonder Sam was surprised. Bobby&#8217;s coat
was torn, his blouse grimed with mud. A great
bruise was on one cheek, and his cap was crushed
and dirty. His hands and face looked as though
he had been rolling in the mud, which, as we
know, he had.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a fight,&#8221; explained Bobby coolly. &#8220;I
guess I do look a little dirty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on out to the garage and I&#8217;ll brush
you off. No sense in scaring your mother stiff,&#8221;
said Sam. &#8220;Who won the fight?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I guess old Hornbeck did,&#8221; answered Bobby
thoughtfully, rubbing a finger that was sore from
handling the ball. &#8220;Anyway, he had a lot to
say about it.&#8221; And then he gave Sam a few particulars
as he cleaned himself.</p>
<p>A few days later Meg and Bobby were going
home from school when Meg suddenly remembered
that she had forgotten her books.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose we can go back and get &#8217;em,&#8221;
grumbled Bobby, &#8220;but why won&#8217;t to-morrow
do? What do you want them for to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you,&#8221; said Meg patiently. &#8220;Mother
is going to cover them with calico, the way she
had her books when she was little. Some of the
covers are so torn I hate to have to use them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; sighed Bobby. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go back.
I think girls have the worst memories!&#8221;</p>
<p>By the time they reached the school&ndash;&ndash;they had
been half way home&ndash;&ndash;all the other children had
gone. The janitor was sweeping out the lower
hall and grinned cheerfully at them without
stopping his work. Then they passed on to their
own room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it seem funny without anybody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
here?&#8221; asked Meg, beginning to take the books
out of her desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I was the teacher!&#8221; Bobby seated
himself in Miss Mason&#8217;s chair and rapped on
the desk with her ruler. &#8220;First grade, go to the
board!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t,&#8221; giggled Meg, half frightened.
&#8220;She might come in and catch you. Bobby,
stop it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby jumped from the chair and scrambled
off the platform as the door opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said a cheerful, chirping voice, and
Dot and Twaddles marched into the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought we&#8217;d come after you,&#8221; announced
Dot serenely. &#8220;Mother said it was time for
you to be coming. But we didn&#8217;t meet you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to come back and get my books for
Mother to cover,&#8221; explained Meg. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
touch anything, Twaddles. You can carry my
reading book. Come on, Bobby, don&#8217;t let&#8217;s stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the twins had no intention of leaving that
minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it nice in school?&#8221; beamed Twaddles,
eyeing the bowl of goldfish on the window sill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
with interest. &#8220;Oh, Bobby, won&#8217;t you draw us
a picture?&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles had spied the chalk and the blackboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, just one,&#8221; promised Bobby.
&#8220;What&#8217;ll I draw?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Hornbeck,&#8221; snickered Twaddles, who
had never seen the head of the school committee,
but who never missed a word of anything
the older children brought home.</p>
<p>Meg and Dot and Twaddles watched with absorbing
interest as Bobby took up a piece of
chalk and began to draw.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are his whiskers,&#8221; explained Bobby,
making a lot of curly marks. &#8220;Here&#8217;s his chin.
This is his coat collar. And now I&#8217;ll make his
high silk hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby had to stand on his tiptoes to draw this,
and the chalk screeched piercingly as he bore
on it heavily. But the high hat really did look
like the one Mr. Hornbeck wore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now some funny little legs, and he&#8217;s done,&#8221;
announced Bobby, drawing two wavering lines
that had to serve the figure for legs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come on now,&#8221; urged Meg. &#8220;Mother will
be looking for us. Rub it out, Bobby. Suppose
Miss Mason found it in the morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The janitor cleans the boards every night,&#8221;
replied Bobby indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rub it out,&#8221; insisted Meg. &#8220;It would be
mean if some one found it and blamed you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spirit of mischief seized Bobby. He
picked up the eraser as if to do what Meg asked,
then dropped it and took up a piece of chalk.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Old Hornbeck,&#8221; he scrawled under
the picture, the words running downhill across
the board.</p>
<p>A noise at the door caused them all to look
around. There stood Mr. Hornbeck!</p>
<p>Luckily Bobby stood before the drawing he
had made, and quick as a flash Meg darted forward.
Slipping in behind her brother, she managed
to rub the sleeve of her dress over the writing
and smudged the greater part of the picture.
Bobby, who had stood as if paralyzed, the chalk
in his fingers, turned and with a sweep of the
eraser blotted out the rest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What are you children doing here?&#8221; demanded
Mr. Hornbeck severely.</p>
<p>He had not noticed the blackboard at all, for
Twaddles had fixed him with such a fascinating
stare the moment he entered the room that he
had not been able to see any one else at first.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do these small children come to school?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;Why are they here, then? And
aren&#8217;t you the boy I stopped from fighting only
last week?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-s, sir,&#8221; answered Bobby. &#8220;We&#8217;re going
now. My sister had to come back for her books.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be no loitering about the building
after school hours,&#8221; said the committeeman
sternly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll speak to Miss Wright. When you
have finished your school work, you are to go
home immediately. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; murmured the four little Blossoms,
the twins joining in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then go,&#8221; ordered Mr. Hornbeck majestically.</p>
<p>The four were very glad to go, and they lost
no time in getting out of the building.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, I&#8217;m glad you rubbed that out, Meg!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
said Bobby gratefully. &#8220;Just suppose he had
seen it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would he do?&#8221; clamored Twaddles.
&#8220;Keep you in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He might expel me,&#8221; Bobby informed him
gloomily. &#8220;Going to school is no joke, Twaddles.
Is it, Meg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; returned Meg absently, her
eyes and thoughts on something else. &#8220;What
does that big poster say, Bobby?&#8221;</p>
<p>She pointed to a large poster pasted on a pole
across the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go over and read it,&#8221; suggested Bobby.</p>
<p>They crossed over, and Bobby spelled out the
large black and red letters for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goody,&#8221; he announced, &#8220;it&#8217;s a circus! With
a p&#8217;rade, and everything! We&#8217;ll ask Daddy if
we can go.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>CHAPTER XII</p>
<p>AT THE CIRCUS</p>
<p>Although a cold wind was blowing, the
four little Blossoms stayed till Bobby had
read aloud every word on the poster.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s next Wednesday,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;I
guess they&#8217;ll let us out of school for the parade.
Oh, here are some more pictures. Look at the
monkeys!&#8221;</p>
<p>The board fence surrounding the corner lot
was plastered with gorgeous circus posters of
prancing yellow lions, ladies in gauzy skirts riding
on pretty ponies, and mischievous monkeys
climbing up ropes and doing the most wonderful
tricks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we had a monkey,&#8221; said Meg, who
did her best to keep a menagerie.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that man doing?&#8221; demanded Twaddles,
pulling at Bobby&#8217;s sleeve and pointing to
a trapeze performer.</p>
<p>&#8220;He does things like that,&#8221; answered Bobby.
&#8220;You didn&#8217;t go to the circus when it was here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
two years ago, did you, Twaddles? You and
Dot were too little. But I guess maybe you can
go this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms talked of nothing but
the circus after this, and Norah said she knew
that Meg dreamed of lions and tigers every
night. All but one of the Blossoms were going,
the children with Father Blossom in the afternoon,
and Norah with Sam at night. Mother
Blossom had planned to spend the night with a
friend in the city, and as she didn&#8217;t care much
about circuses anyway, she thought she wouldn&#8217;t
postpone her trip.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about school?&#8221; asked Father Blossom,
coming home one evening to find Twaddles
wrapped up in the fur rug and playing he was a
polar bear, while Meg and Bobby, each under a
chair, growled like panthers, and Dot swung
from the curtain pole pretending that she was a
trapeze performer. &#8220;What do you do about getting
excused, Bobby? Really, Dot, you&#8217;ll have
that curtain pole down in a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flushed and smiling, Dot dropped to the
floor, and Twaddles came out of his rug.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>&#8220;School lets us out at eleven o&#8217;clock, so we
can see the parade,&#8221; announced Bobby. &#8220;Then
there isn&#8217;t any more after that. Some of the
school committee said it was nonsense to close
the school for a circus, but Mr. Carter said he
wasn&#8217;t going to give us a chance to play hooky.
Everybody&#8217;s going, Daddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dot and Twaddles want to meet the children
up town to see the parade. So you think that
is safe, Ralph?&#8221; asked Mother Blossom, coming
into the room to tell them that supper was ready.
&#8220;There will be such a crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They mustn&#8217;t go alone,&#8221; said Father Blossom
quickly. &#8220;Let Sam take them. They can
all sit in Steve Broadwell&#8217;s window. He asked
me to-day if they didn&#8217;t want to come. And as
soon as the parade is over, come home to lunch.
I&#8217;ll meet you here and we&#8217;ll get an early start.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Wednesday morning, circus day, came at
last. Very little work was done in school, and
the teachers were as glad as the boys and girls
when the dismissal bell rang, for trying to keep
the minds of restless little mortals on geography
and arithmetic when they are thinking only of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
monkeys and bears and lions is not an easy task.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to see the parade?&#8221; asked Palmer Davis,
as Miss Mason&#8217;s class poured down the stairway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to see the parade?&#8221; the girls asked
Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Bobby answered for both. &#8220;We&#8217;re going
to sit in Mr. Steve Broadwell&#8217;s window.
You can see fine from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stephen Broadwell was a druggist, and his
window upstairs over his drugstore was a coveted
place for parades of all kinds in Oak Hill.
Everything paraded up the main street past the
drugstore.</p>
<p>Meg and Bobby found Sam and the twins already
waiting for them when they hurried up
the steep dark stairs that led to the storeroom
over the drugstore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Been here half an hour,&#8221; grinned Sam. &#8220;Dot
was so afraid she&#8217;d miss the start that she wanted
me to bring her in the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms squeezed into the
window and Sam looked over their shoulders.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Music!&#8221; cried Dot. &#8220;I hear it! They&#8217;re coming!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see &#8217;em!&#8221; shouted Bobby, leaning out to
look. &#8220;My, see the horses, Meg!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam pulled him in again, and in another minute
the parade was marching by in full swing.
You know how wonderful a circus parade is;
that is, if you have ever seen one. And if you
haven&#8217;t, goodness! we couldn&#8217;t begin to do it
justice. Of course the very largest circuses didn&#8217;t
come to Oak Hill; but still this one had many
things to see. There were cream-colored horses
and black ones, with girls dressed in pink and
blue and white fluffy dresses and gorgeous long
red coats, riding them. There were cages of animals,
some of them sleeping and some switching
their tails angrily and showing their teeth. There
was a whole wagon load of monkeys, two bands,
and even an elephant and a camel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be awful if we couldn&#8217;t go to
the circus?&#8221; said Bobby solemnly, as the last of
the procession, the clown driving his own cunning
pony and cart, went up the street. &#8220;After
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
seeing that parade I never could be happy &#8217;less
I saw them at the circus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we are going,&#8221; Meg reminded him
practically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hurry,&#8221; urged Twaddles. &#8220;Maybe all
the seats will be gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy bought tickets,&#8221; said Dot dreamily.
&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t the first pony pretty? And did you see
the little dog riding on him? Do you suppose
Philip could ride a pony, Meg?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg was sure Philip could, if he had a pony
to ride and some one to teach him.</p>
<p>As the four little Blossoms and Sam went
downstairs whom should they meet but Doctor
Maynard, an old friend of the whole Blossom
family, and the doctor who had helped them set
Philip&#8217;s leg when he had broken it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said the doctor, smiling, &#8220;I
think I know what you have been doing upstairs&ndash;&ndash;watching
the circus parade. And now
where to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Home,&#8221; replied Meg. &#8220;We have to hurry,
&#8217;cause Daddy is going to take us to the circus
this afternoon.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose you would have time to have
a soda?&#8221; asked the doctor.</p>
<p>The children thought they would, and Doctor
Maynard lined them up before the fountain and
let each one choose. Meg and Bobby, who always
liked the same things, took chocolate, and
Dot asked for strawberry, while Twaddles said
he would have orange. Doctor Maynard and
Sam had ginger-ale, which Meg privately
thought unpleasant stuff, it tickled one&#8217;s throat
so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a good time at the circus,&#8221; said the
doctor, as they said good-by. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tease the
elephant, and don&#8217;t let the monkeys tease you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think the monkeys would be cold
in the winter,&#8221; mused Meg, as they walked
home. &#8220;Bears and lions have warm furry skins,
but monkeys don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the circus rests up in winter,&#8221; Sam assured
her. &#8220;This is about the last stop they&#8217;ll
make this season. When it gets too cold for
folks to sit out in tents, you know, a circus goes
into winter quarters. They are just as cozy then
as you are. All the circus people mend their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
clothes and rest and plan out new tricks for the
spring. And the animals rest and sleep and get
their coats into good condition, and have all they
want to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>At home the four little Blossoms found
Father Blossom, and as soon as they had finished
lunch they started for the big tent. It was
pitched in the same place every time the circus
came to Oak Hill, a wide open space just outside
the town limits, and Bobby remembered it
very well.</p>
<p>&#8220;See all the people!&#8221; cried Dot, jumping up
and down with delight. &#8220;There&#8217;s Nina and
Mary and Freddy, and oh, everybody!&#8221;</p>
<p>It did seem as if all Oak Hill had turned out
to go to the circus, and Bobby wondered if there
would be any left to see it that night when Sam
and Norah went.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tickets,&#8221; said the man at the gate. &#8220;All right,
five of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went into the big tent and found their
seats down near the ring. The clown was already
driving around and around in his pony
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
cart, and he waved to Dot quite as if he knew
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he remembers me from this morning,&#8221;
she said with satisfaction.</p>
<p>More people kept coming in, and soon the tent
was crowded. Then the matin&eacute;e began, with
a grand parade all around the ring, horses
prancing, whips cracking, the monkeys shrieking
shrilly. For three hours the four little Blossoms
were enthralled by the antics of the clever
beasts and the men and women performers, and
they could hardly believe it when Father Blossom
said they must put on their hats, for the
performance was over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t there be any more?&#8221; begged Dot, putting
on her hat backward in her excitement.
&#8220;Just a little more, Daddy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we&#8217;ve been here three hours,&#8221; said
Father Blossom, smiling. &#8220;The circus has to
have its supper and be ready for the evening
crowd, you know. You wouldn&#8217;t want them to
be too tired to go through their tricks for Norah
and Sam, would you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course Dot didn&#8217;t want the circus to get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
completely tired out, so she agreed that perhaps
it was time to go home.</p>
<p>They brought Norah such glowing accounts
of the things they had seen that she was &#8220;all in
a flutter,&#8221; she said, and indeed she did serve the
potatoes in a soup dish. But as Father Blossom
said, most anything was likely to happen on circus
day.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must all go to bed extra early to-night,&#8221;
he warned the children. &#8220;If Meg and Bobby
are late for school to-morrow, the circus will be
blamed. Dot looks as if she couldn&#8217;t keep her
eyes open another minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg and Bobby went to bed when the twins&#8217;
bedtime came, for they were tired, and they fell
asleep at once. But suddenly the loud ringing
of the telephone bell woke them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>A MONKEY HUNT</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Daddy! Daddy!&#8221; cried Meg, tumbling
out of bed and running into the hall.
&#8220;There&#8217;s the telephone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Blossom came out of his room. He
had been reading and was fully dressed, for it
was not late for grown-up people, only about
ten o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going, Daughter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Perhaps
Mother has decided to come out on the late
train.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg leaned over the banisters to listen, and
Bobby joined her there. The twins did not wake
up, for they were sound sleepers.</p>
<p>Father Blossom took down the receiver and
said &#8220;Hello!&#8221; Then they heard him ask a quick,
low question or two, and then he laughed. How
he laughed! He threw back his head and fairly
shouted. Meg and Bobby had to laugh, too,
though they had not the faintest idea what the
joke was about.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>When Father Blossom hung the receiver up,
he was still laughing. He glanced up and saw
Meg and Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get cold. Run back to bed,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;That was Sam telephoning. What do you suppose
happened? The cage of monkeys upset in
the ring and the door-catch broke and they&#8217;re
all loose! Sam said half the audience chased
them around the tent and it broke up the show.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they catch them?&#8221; asked Meg, her eyes
big with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not one,&#8221; answered her father. &#8220;Get into
bed immediately, children. Perhaps you&#8217;ll meet
monkeys on your way to school to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we could,&#8221; murmured Meg, cuddling
sleepily into her warm bed. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that be
fun!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to catch a monkey,&#8221; said Bobby to
himself, as he climbed into his bed in the next
room. &#8220;Maybe he&#8217;d do tricks for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the morning Meg and Bobby were out in
the kitchen before breakfast, getting from Norah
the details of the monkeys&#8217; escape.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Deed then, I hope they catch every one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
&#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;bad &#8217;cess to &#8217;em,&#8221; said Norah indignantly.
&#8220;Thieving, sly, little torments! Didn&#8217;t they
claw Mrs. O&#8217;Toole&#8217;s bonnet nigh off her head
last night, to say nothing of scaring her into fits?
Don&#8217;t say monkey to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>On their way to school the children found that
the news of the overturned monkey cage was
known to the whole town. Not a boy who didn&#8217;t
hope to be able to catch a monkey or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a reward offered&ndash;&ndash;five dollars for
each monkey,&#8221; Palmer Davis reported when he
met Meg and Bobby at the school door. &#8220;Yep&ndash;&ndash;my
cousin told me; and he&#8217;s in the Oak Hill
<i>Daily Advertiser</i> office, and I guess he ought to
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>The majority of the children in Miss Mason&#8217;s
room stayed downstairs till the &#8220;warning bell&#8221;
rang and then hurried to their room to put away
their coats and hats in the cloak room. It was
Miss Mason&#8217;s rule that they must be quietly in
their seats, ready for the march to the assembly
hall, when the nine o&#8217;clock bell rang.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too cold to hang around out here, so let&#8217;s
go up,&#8221; suggested Palmer Davis on this morning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
&#8220;The warning bell will ring in a minute, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg and Bobby were willing, especially as
the air was sharp and chill, cold enough for
snow Meg thought, though of course it never
snowed so early in the fall, and they trooped
happily upstairs. A number of boys and girls
were already in the room and Miss Mason was
working at her desk. Her hat was off and lay
on one of the school desks, for she meant to carry
it over to the teacher&#8217;s room as soon as she had
worked out an example for the little girl who
had asked her help.</p>
<p>Nina Mills pushed her way into the cloak
room ahead of Meg and Bobby, and as the latter
grasped the swinging door they heard Nina give
a loud yell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out! Get away!&#8221; She came tumbling
out of the cloak room, her face white with terror.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a monkey in there!&#8221; she gasped.</p>
<p>Half of the pupils immediately scattered.
Most of the girls fled screaming, and some of
the boys followed them. Miss Mason stood up,
undecided what to do.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Get a pole and kill him!&#8221; shouted Tim Roon,
from a safe position behind the bookcase. &#8220;Mash
him &#8217;fore he has a chance to fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly,&#8221; snapped Bobby. &#8220;A monkey
can&#8217;t hurt you. Let&#8217;s catch it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, no one had any experience, in catching
a monkey, and they were willing to let Bobby go
about it as he saw fit.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of you hold open the door,&#8221; he decided
after a minute&#8217;s thought. &#8220;Meg, you stand there
and hold out your dress. I&#8217;ll go in and chase
him out to you. Are you afraid? &#8217;Cause I&#8217;ll
stand to catch him and you can chase him out if
you&#8217;d rather. Only your dress will help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg said she wasn&#8217;t afraid and took her place
in the doorway. Palmer Davis volunteered to
hold the door back, and the others stood as far
away as they could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out! Here he comes!&#8221; shouted Bobby
suddenly.</p>
<p>Meg spread out her skirts. A small, black
ball hurled itself through the door, rolled between
Meg&#8217;s feet and jumped to a desk. Like a
flash the monkey ran lightly over the desk tops,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
down the aisle, reached the desk where Miss
Mason&#8217;s hat lay, and seized it in one paw. She
made a frantic grab for it, but missed. With a
derisive chuckle and some remark in monkey
talk that no one could understand, the monkey
gained the open window and scampered down
the fire-escape.</p>
<p>&#8220;My best, new hat! Run after him!&#8221; wailed
Miss Mason.</p>
<p>The nine o&#8217;clock bell had rung five minutes
before, but no one thought of that. The entire
school knew that one of the circus monkeys had
been found in Miss Mason&#8217;s room, and there
was no question of holding assembly till it was
driven out or captured.</p>
<p>Pell-mell down the stairs ran the children
after the monkey. His quick eyes glanced about
for a haven. A tall pine tree stood near the front
gate, and toward this the monkey ran, a pack of
screaming children after him. He had the best
of them when it came to climbing, and before the
first boy reached the tree he was half way to the
top.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t climb that,&#8221; said a fourth-grade
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
pupil disconsolately. &#8220;All the branches have
been cut to keep it off the ground. How&#8217;ll we
ever get that hat back?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Miss Mason had no intention of losing
her best hat, and she was already telephoning
for one of the town firemen to come and bring
his longest ladder. When he heard that he was
to rescue a monkey he was indignant; then when
she reminded him of the reward, he thought that
after all he might be able to do it. So the children
had the fun of watching him come with his
ladder and climb up to get, after some difficulty,
both monkey and hat.</p>
<p>Dear knows when the children would have
gone back to school after the monkey was
brought down, for he proved to be a friendly
animal and was evidently used to petting, and
every one was eager to make his acquaintance,
but Miss Wright finally came out and ordered
them all into the building, and after that affairs
gradually settled down. But many were the
secret wishes that every school day could start
with a monkey hunt.</p>
<p>At noon Meg and Bobby had so much to tell,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
and the twins were so interested and so full of
self-pity to think that they couldn&#8217;t go to school
and find monkeys in the cloak room that Mother
Blossom&#8217;s piece of news was almost overlooked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have something nice to tell you,&#8221; she said
at last, smiling mysteriously, as she helped them
to pudding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something nice?&#8221; puzzled Meg. &#8220;Can Annabel
Lee sleep on my bed?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg was sure that the comfortable kitchen
was not comfortable enough for the cat, and she
teased persistently to be allowed to have Annabel
Lee sleep at the foot of her bed at night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing at all to do with Annabel Lee,&#8221; said
Mother Blossom. &#8220;This is something that will
please you all. Don&#8217;t play with your spoon,
Bobby&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll be late going back to school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Company?&#8221; demanded Twaddles, who was
very hospitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw the letter come,&#8221; laughed Mother
Blossom. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll have to help you this much&ndash;&ndash;we
<i>are</i> going to have company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; cried Meg, almost choking over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
her pudding. &#8220;I know! Aunt Polly&#8217;s coming!
Oh, goody!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she, Mother?&#8221; asked Bobby delightedly.
&#8220;Honest? When? Soon? Can we go to meet
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s coming,&#8221; replied Mother Blossom.
&#8220;Not right away. About a week before
Thanksgiving, she says, and then she&#8217;ll stay over
the holiday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s ever so far off,&#8221; objected Twaddles.
&#8220;I thought maybe she&#8217;d come to-morrow
or to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanksgiving is only about three weeks off,&#8221;
she reminded him. &#8220;Aunt Polly will be here
in less than two weeks. And Meg and Bobby
have to begin to practice their Thanksgiving
pieces soon, don&#8217;t you, children?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Mason&#8217;s going to give &#8217;em out this afternoon,&#8221;
replied Bobby. &#8220;Say, Mother, do I have
to learn a piece? Girls like to wear fussy clothes
and get up on the platform and speak or sing,
but I feel awful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that will be for your teacher to say,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
returned Mother Blossom. &#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose
either you or Meg will have to learn very long
poems. And think, dear, wouldn&#8217;t you like to
have a part in the exercises when Aunt Polly
will be here to see you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby hadn&#8217;t thought of that. Perhaps he
would like to have Aunt Polly hear him recite
something.</p>
<p>&#8220;But nothing with gestures,&#8221; he said firmly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to get up there and wave my
hands and yell.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>AUNT POLLY ARRIVES</h3>
</div>
<p>When Meg and Bobby came home from
school that afternoon they brought the
news that each had been given a Thanksgiving
recitation to learn. Miss Mason did not feel as
sure as she had at first that it was Bobby who
had spoiled her book. Mr. Carter&#8217;s championship
of Bobby was not without results. Still, she
did not wholly absolve him, and while she was
fair enough not to mention the subject again,
Bobby knew that she had not forgotten. He was
surprised when his name was read aloud as one
to have part in the exercises.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s six of us boys,&#8221; announced Bobby to
Mother Blossom. &#8220;We all come out at once
and take turns saying a verse. Tim Roon and
Charlie Black aren&#8217;t in it. Miss Mason said
that last year they promised to learn a part and
they never even tried. And then they spoiled
the whole thing by staying away from the exercises.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>Meg was waiting her turn impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the longest piece!&#8221; she began breathlessly
the moment Bobby finished. &#8220;Five verses,
Mother! And we&#8217;re not going to have any time
to study in school! Will you hear me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom said of course she would, and
Meg began studying her verses that very night
after supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to have a new white dress,&#8221; decided
Mother Blossom. &#8220;You&#8217;re growing so
fast, Meg, that none of your summer dresses will
do. I&#8217;ll have to call up Miss Florence and see,
if you can stop in to be measured to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>For cheerful little Miss Florence, who flitted
about from house to house making pretty dresses
for little girls and their mothers and sisters, had
sprained her ankle a day or two before and Doctor
Maynard would not hear of her leaving the
house for weeks and weeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucky it wasn&#8217;t my wrist,&#8221; Miss Florence
had laughed. &#8220;I can still sew, if my customers
come to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom telephoned that afternoon,
and Miss Florence said that she could begin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
Meg&#8217;s new dress early the next week. She would
only have to come two or three times to try it
on, and then Miss Florence would send word
when she or Bobby might come after it. Miss
Florence had no one to run errands for her.</p>
<p>What with practicing &#8220;pieces,&#8221; and being
fitted for a new dress, and going to school and
playing a little every day, the time fairly flew,
and before Meg and Bobby knew it Aunt Polly
had come.</p>
<p>&#8220;How you&#8217;ve grown!&#8221; she cried when she saw
the four little Blossoms. &#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t believe
Jud would know you if he saw you.&#8221; Jud had
been a great friend of the children&#8217;s when they
visited Aunt Polly at Brookside Farm, and they
had other friends to ask after, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s Carlotta?&#8221; demanded Meg eagerly.
Carlotta was the calf given to Meg and Bobby
as a reward for help they had given one of Aunt
Polly&#8217;s neighbors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carlotta is growing,&#8221; said Aunt Polly, smiling.
&#8220;And Linda is going to school, which
leaves me all alone in the house. I declare I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
was glad to close it and come down to you, Margaret.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Polly was Mother Blossom&#8217;s widowed
older sister. The children loved her dearly, and
now, each with a red apple in hand from the bag
Aunt Polly had brought them, they crowded
around to ask if she wouldn&#8217;t like them to rehearse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rehearse?&#8221; asked Aunt Polly, puzzled.
&#8220;Rehearse what, blessings?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bobby and I have to speak a piece in school
the day before Thanksgiving,&#8221; explained Meg,
&#8220;and the twins always have to say poetry, too,
when we practice. Mother hears us every night;
don&#8217;t you, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What fun!&#8221; Aunt Polly clapped her hands,
her eyes sparkling. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ve
been to any school exercises. By all means have
a rehearsal, Meg. Your father, mother and I
will be the audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The children went out of the room, and Bobby
came back alone. He went to the center of the
room, bowed a little stiffly and said his six-line
verse rapidly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it will sound better with six boys
taking turns,&#8221; he explained, slipping into a chair
near Aunt Polly to enjoy the rest of the entertainment.
&#8220;My, I hope I don&#8217;t forget it that
afternoon!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot came next, walking composedly, and she
gave them &#8220;Twinkle, twinkle, little star,&#8221; her old
stand-by; that was one verse Dot was always
sure of.</p>
<p>When Twaddles&#8217; turn came he bowed,
thought for a full minute, and then launched
into the Mother Goose rhyme of &#8220;Peter, Peter,
Pumpkin Eater.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pumpkins are for Thanksgiving,&#8221; he assured
Aunt Polly anxiously, in case she should think
his selection strange.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course they are!&#8221; she cried, drawing
Twaddles into her lap and hugging him. &#8220;I
suspect Jud is packing the largest he can find
into a box now to send us for our pies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg had been upstairs and put on one of her
summer white dresses, too short in the skirt and
too tight in the sleeves, for Meg, as Mother Blossom
had said, was growing very fast.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You just ought to see the dress Miss Florence
is making me, Aunt Polly,&#8221; Meg said, her
blue eyes shining. &#8220;It has two tucks in the skirt,
and puff sleeves&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a pink sash,&#8221; chimed in Dot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what about your piece?&#8221; asked Father
Blossom. &#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose there is any danger
that you&#8217;ll march up on the platform Wednesday
afternoon and recite a verse about pink
sashes and tucks, do you, instead of Thanksgiving?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg was sure she wouldn&#8217;t do that, and to
prove it, she recited her whole five verses very
nicely, and with no mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has gestures&ndash;&ndash;Mother showed her how,&#8221;
said Bobby, very proud of his pretty sister. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t like to wave my hands, but I like to watch
other people do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few days before the all-important Wednesday
Miss Florence telephoned&ndash;&ndash;she had a telephone
in her house now that she could not go
out&ndash;&ndash;and said that Meg&#8217;s dress was finished.
When Bobby and Meg came home from school
at noon for lunch, Mother Blossom told them to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
go around by Miss Florence&#8217;s house that afternoon
and get the frock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear, dear, if I&#8217;m not stupid,&#8221; fussed Miss
Florence, folding the crisp, dainty folds of the
dress a few minutes after the children had rung
her bell and announced they were to take the
package. &#8220;Here I&#8217;ve gone and saved this nice
box for it, and it hasn&#8217;t a lid. If I lay sheets
of tissue paper over it and pin them carefully,
do you think you can carry it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I can,&#8221; said Bobby. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need a
cover, Miss Florence. Come on, Meg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful and don&#8217;t drop it,&#8221; warned Miss
Florence, hobbling on her lame ankle to the door
to watch them down the steps. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a miserable
day out!&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg and Bobby didn&#8217;t think it was a miserable
day, though the wind was raw and cold,
and the ground, soft from the first freeze, was
slippery and muddy. But, as Bobby had once
said, they were fond of &#8220;just plain weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; wailed Meg when they were half
way home, &#8220;here comes that mean, disagreeable
Tim Roon. He&#8217;s the hatefulest boy!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>Tim Roon, as usual, was loitering along, his
hands in his pockets, his lips puckered up for the
whistle that didn&#8217;t come. Tim never quite did
anything he started to do, whether it was to weed
his father&#8217;s garden or whistle a tune.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he said, stopping close to Meg.
&#8220;What have we in the large box?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go &#8217;way,&#8221; returned Meg fearfully. &#8220;Leave
Bobby be. That&#8217;s my new dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim&#8217;s voice changed to a high, squeaky, thin
note.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Call me early, Mother,&#8217;&#8221; he chortled, &#8220;&#8216;for
I&#8217;m to be Queen of the May, Mother, I&#8217;m to be
Queen of the May.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You take the box, Meg,&#8221; said Bobby angrily,
&#8220;while I hit that big chump.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg reached for the box, but Tim was quicker
and he knocked it spinning. Then away he went,
running at top speed, his shouts of laughter echoing
up the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s all mud!&#8221; mourned Meg, crying
a little. &#8220;Oh, Bobby, did it fall in a puddle?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby was peeping under the tissue paper
covers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t hurt a mite,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Not one
spot, Meg. See, the box fell right side up. Isn&#8217;t
that lucky?&#8221;</p>
<p>Just at that moment Charlie Black came flying
around the corner on his roller skates and ran
into Meg before he could stop himself. He
knocked her down and landed on top of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meg, Meg, did he hurt you?&#8221; Bobby had
Meg on her feet in a second. &#8220;No? You sure?
Well, just you watch me pound him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby was furious, and hitting Charlie Black
he felt would relieve his feeling almost as much
as a fight with Tim Roon. The two bad boys
never lost an opportunity to torment him or
Meg, and Bobby felt that here was a heaven-sent
opportunity to even up old scores.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got my skates on,&#8221; whimpered Charlie,
as Bobby leaned over him. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare
touch me, Bobby Blossom! Go &#8217;way! I tell you
&#8217;tisn&#8217;t fair! I&#8217;ve got my skates on!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t care if you have!&#8221; roared
Bobby. &#8220;Stand up, and see what you&#8217;ll get!
Stand up!&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie much preferred to lie down, and now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
he simply rolled over on his back and pawed
the air wildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare touch me!&#8221; he kept crying.
&#8220;Go away! Leave me alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby looked disgusted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You leave me alone and I&#8217;ll give you something,&#8221;
Charlie whimpered. &#8220;Honest I will,
Bobby.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; said Bobby shortly.</p>
<p>Charlie Black sat up and tried to grin at
Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got four kittens,&#8221; he said, careless as usual
of his grammar. &#8220;They&#8217;re beauties.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>MR. FRITZ&#8217;S KITTENS</h3>
</div>
<p>Of course Meg&#8217;s attention was held at
once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get any kittens, Charlie?&#8221;
she asked, half inclined not to believe him.</p>
<p>Charlie wriggled along the ground till he was
a safe distance from Bobby, then scrambled to
his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man gave &#8217;em to me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He wants
me to drown &#8217;em!&#8221; and away he skated as fast
as he could go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bobby!&#8221; Meg almost screamed. &#8220;Bobby!
don&#8217;t let him drown the kittens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg was, as her family said, &#8220;crazy&#8221; about
all animals, and kittens were her special delight.
But then Bobby didn&#8217;t like the idea of drowning
four helpless little cats in the icy cold water of
the pond, either. He started after Charlie
Black, and Meg went after him and really
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
wished she didn&#8217;t have a new dress for a moment
because she found the box a nuisance to carry.</p>
<p>Charlie could skate fairly well, but that was
when he was watching where he was going.
This time he was watching Bobby instead and as
a result he failed to see a curb and went over
it with a jolt that landed him on his knees. Before
he could rise, Bobby and Meg had caught
Up with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&ndash;&ndash;are&ndash;&ndash;the&ndash;&ndash;kittens?&#8221; gasped Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a bag,&#8221; Charlie answered sullenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You give them to us,&#8221; said Bobby sternly.
&#8220;If no one wants them, we can take them home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man said to drown them&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;re his
cats and I guess he has a right to say what he
wants done with them,&#8221; Charlie retorted.</p>
<p>Meg thought about this a minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go see the man,&#8221; she announced calmly.
&#8220;Where are the kittens?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now whether Charlie really didn&#8217;t want to
drown the little, soft helpless kittens, or whether
he was afraid of Bobby&ndash;&ndash;perhaps his reasons
were mixed as reasons often are&ndash;&ndash;no one knew.
But he said that Meg and Bobby could come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
home with him and he would give them the
kittens.</p>
<p>The bag was in the woodshed and it was such
a dirty old bag&ndash;&ndash;made of canvas that looked
as though it had been carried for years and
never washed&ndash;&ndash;that involuntarily Bobby held it
at arms&#8217; length from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t bite you,&#8221; said Charlie scornfully,
thinking he was afraid of the kittens&ndash;&ndash;they
could be heard mewing inside the bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the man&#8217;s name and where does he
live?&#8221; Meg asked quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I was only fooling&ndash;&ndash;he doesn&#8217;t care what
happens to those old cats,&#8221; said Charlie. &#8220;It&#8217;s
Mr. Fritz&ndash;&ndash;over on Beech Street. He&#8217;s cross
enough anyway without being asked a lot of
extra questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Meg was determined to see Mr. Fritz
and she made Bobby go around to Beech Street
with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as Charlie said&ndash;&ndash;they are his kittens,&#8221;
she argued. &#8220;And of course if he says
they have to be drowned they have to be: only
we won&#8217;t do it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to look at them?&#8221; asked
Bobby, swinging the bag gently.</p>
<p>Meg shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if somebody has to drown them,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Fritz lived in a large old-fashioned house,
set back from the street. When the children
rang the door bell a deaf woman who did all
the housework for him&ndash;&ndash;he was an old bachelor&ndash;&ndash;came
to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to buy anything,&#8221; she declared,
frowning at the bag Bobby was carrying.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not selling anything&ndash;&ndash;these are kittens,&#8221;
Bobby explained, but without raising his
voice. He didn&#8217;t know she was deaf.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kittens!&#8221; Bobby repeated, a little more
loudly. &#8220;Mr. Fritz&#8217;s kittens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wears gloves,&#8221; said the maid crossly.
&#8220;And my bread is in the oven and I can&#8217;t be
bothered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg stood on tiptoe and shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Fritz home?&#8221; she cried.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>To her dismay a deep voice somewhere back
in the house answered her.</p>
<p>&#8220;That he is,&#8221; it said. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you come in?&#8221;
and there stood Mr. Fritz himself, looking at
her curiously.</p>
<p>Bobby with the bag and Meg with her dress
box, stepped inside and the maid closed the
door. That made the hall so dark that poor
Bobby, unable to see where he was going, but
moving ahead blindly, walked to the basement
stairs and made the most fearful clatter as
he lost his balance and fell half way. He managed
to catch one arm around the banister rail
and check his descent, but the bag of kittens
went all the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bobby! Are you hurt?&#8221; Meg called fearfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless me, child, I hope you haven&#8217;t broken
anything,&#8221; said Mr. Fritz anxiously.</p>
<p>Bobby felt his way to the bottom of the stairs
and found the bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless I smashed the kittens,&#8221; he said
cheerfully, toiling up again.</p>
<p>Mr. Fritz opened the door of a room at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
back of the house and enough light came out
to show Bobby and Meg how to go in. Once
inside they found it was evidently Mr. Fritz&#8217;s
sitting room. It was rather untidy, but comfortable
and warm, with books and papers
spread about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what can I do for you?&#8221; said Mr. Fritz,
looking at his visitors very kindly and trying
not to show that he was surprised to see them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Bobby Blossom,&#8221; Bobby introduced himself,
&#8220;and this is my sister Meg. We came to
ask you if you would care if your kittens weren&#8217;t
drowned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? My kittens&ndash;&ndash;not drowned?&#8221; repeated
Mr. Fritz. &#8220;But they are&ndash;&ndash;I gave that Charlie&ndash;&ndash;what&#8217;s
his name&ndash;&ndash;Black, I gave Charlie Black
fifty cents to drown them for me this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg looked ready to cry. Any one that <i>paid</i>
to have kittens drowned, must, of course, get
what he paid for.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t say you paid him,&#8221; Bobby said
slowly. &#8220;Meg and I thought perhaps you
wouldn&#8217;t care and we could keep them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are those the kittens in that bag?&#8221; asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
Mr. Fritz. &#8220;Do you mean to tell me that worthless
boy hasn&#8217;t done anything with them? And
he sends them back to me? Wait till I catch
him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he didn&#8217;t send them!&#8221; Meg cried in
quick alarm. &#8220;He told us he had them and
Bobby and I wouldn&#8217;t let him drown them.
Then he said they were your kittens and you
wanted them drowned. And of course you can
do anything you want to with your kittens, but
I thought you wouldn&#8217;t mind if we kept them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Fritz nodded his head several times.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; he said at each nod. &#8220;I see&ndash;&ndash;you
want to save the kittens and let them grow up
and howl on the back fences. Well, I think there
are enough cats in this world already. But as
long as I don&#8217;t have to take care of the kittens, it
makes no difference to me what becomes of them.
You may have them, if you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg thanked him and was ready to go, but
Bobby had something else on his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want that fifty cents back from Charlie
Black?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could get it for me, I suppose,&#8221; Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
Fritz said with a laugh. &#8220;No, Bobby, let him
keep his fifty cents. After all, he earned it, for
the stipulation was that he was to dispose of
the kittens. I didn&#8217;t say they <i>must</i> be drowned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Fritz shook hands with Bobby and Meg
and asked them to come and see him again. He
went to the door with them, which was fortunate
for the hall was so dark Meg was afraid Bobby
would fall downstairs a second time, and
watched them go down the gravel path.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to hurry,&#8221; said Bobby. &#8220;Mother
will wonder where we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The twins saw them coming and their sharp
eyes spied the bag the first thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you got, Bobby?&#8221; shrieked Dot.
&#8220;Bobby, what&#8217;s in the bag?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t tell the neighborhood,&#8221; Bobby
said a little crossly, for he was tired, &#8220;but kittens
are in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kittens!&#8221; Twaddles shouted, leaping ahead
to spread the news.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; he called, racing into the house.
&#8220;Oh, Mother, come and see the kittens Bobby
has in a bag!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>Mother Blossom and Aunt Polly and Norah
came into the hall and Bobby sat down on the
rug, with Meg and the twins almost on top of
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re four,&#8221; he explained as he began to
untie the string that was knotted around the
bag. &#8220;Charlie Black was going to drown them
for Mr. Fritz, but he said Meg could have
them. Maybe they are pretty.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned down the bag and a black kitten
walked out. Then a gray and white one. Then
a yellow one and next a striped &#8220;tiger&#8221; kitten.</p>
<p>Norah started to laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Four, is it?&#8221; she giggled. &#8220;Then I must be
seeing double, Bobby, for there&#8217;s six already
and&ndash;&ndash;yes, here&#8217;s another&ndash;&ndash;that makes seven!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, there they were&ndash;&ndash;seven kittens, none
especially fat and none especially pretty, all &#8220;just
kittens,&#8221; as Twaddles named them.</p>
<p>But Meg thought they were lovely and she
was anxious to take them out to the garage and
give them some warm milk. The garage was
always chosen as a good place to feed stray
animals, for the cement floor could be more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
easily washed than the linoleum that was the
pride of Norah&#8217;s heart in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meg, darling, we simply cannot keep all
those kittens,&#8221; Mother Blossom declared regretfully.
&#8220;Seven kittens are a great many and
I don&#8217;t believe Annabel Lee will welcome so
much company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mother, we can&#8217;t drown them!&#8221; said
Meg, her eyes round with horror. &#8220;We have
to take care of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you children will have to find homes
for them,&#8221; Mother Blossom announced. &#8220;Think
over all the folk you know and try to find homes
for these homeless little cats. That will be something
for you to do, too, Dot and Twaddles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to think now,&#8221; said Twaddles, sitting
down on the lowest step of the stairs.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XVI_WHAT_TWADDLES_THOUGHT_ABOUT' id='CHAPTER_XVI_WHAT_TWADDLES_THOUGHT_ABOUT'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>WHAT TWADDLES THOUGHT ABOUT</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to think, too,&#8221; Dot declared,
sitting down beside Twaddles, to his great
annoyance.</p>
<p>&#8220;You always talk,&#8221; he complained, as Dot
pushed him over toward the wall.</p>
<p>Meg and Bobby postponed their thoughts till
they had taken the kittens out to the garage and
fed them. They begged a piece of rug from
Norah and an old box from Sam, and they made
a comfortable bed.</p>
<p>When they came in from their labors, Twaddles
was still sitting on the stair step, but Dot
had disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s your brain working, Twaddles?&#8221;
asked Bobby, as older brothers do.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s working,&#8221; Twaddles answered soberly.</p>
<p>Norah said supper was ready at that moment,
so there wasn&#8217;t time to find out what Twaddles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
was thinking. And after supper came bedtime
at its usual fast pace&ndash;&ndash;the four little Blossoms
were sure that something happened to the clock
between supper and bedtime; the hands came
unscrewed, or something, and went around twice
as fast as they worked the rest of the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find homes for the kittens when we
come home this afternoon,&#8221; Meg promised at
the breakfast table the next morning. &#8220;I&#8217;ve fed
them, Mother, and can&#8217;t Dot and Twaddles take
them some milk this noon? Miss Mason wants
us to stay and practice the songs for Thanksgiving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norah had put up a neat little lunch for Meg
and another for Bobby and the twins were almost
beside themselves with envy. Would the time
ever come, they thought, when they could go to
school and sometimes have to stay over the noon
hour and not come home to lunch? They were
sure there could be nothing more exciting, except
the actual going to school, than taking one&#8217;s
lunch in a boy and eating it with a crowd of
other hungry children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go see the kittens,&#8221; Twaddles suggested,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
as soon as Bobby and Meg had gone.</p>
<p>Dot trotted after him to the garage. They
found Sam busily picking up little furry bodies
and scolding under his breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;These blamed cats,&#8221; he told the children,
&#8220;don&#8217;t know when they&#8217;re well off. They keep
climbing out of that box and first thing you
know I&#8217;m going to step on one; then there will
be a nice squalling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot and Twaddles helped him stuff the kittens
into the box and he pulled the rug over
the top, saying that if it was dark enough inside,
perhaps they would go to sleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to take your father out to the foundry,&#8221;
said Sam, opening the big door. &#8220;Now see that
I don&#8217;t run over any live stock on my way out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The twins watched him take the car and saw
to it that no kittens were in his path. As soon
as he had gone, Twaddles looked at Dot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let you and me find homes for &#8217;em,&#8221; he said
distinctly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Homes for the kittens?&#8221; Dot asked doubtfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. We can do it,&#8221; declared Twaddles
with magnificent confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose people don&#8217;t want them,&#8221; Dot offered.
&#8220;Lots of people have cats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, lots haven&#8217;t,&#8221; was Twaddles&#8217; reply to
this argument. &#8220;We&#8217;ll keep going till we find
the folks who haven&#8217;t any.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Dot was not feeling ambitious that morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re awfully heavy to carry,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and they cry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Twaddles showed that he had spent
much time and thought on his plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll only carry one&ndash;&ndash;for a sample!&#8221; he told
her triumphantly. &#8220;A cat is a cat, isn&#8217;t it? And
we&#8217;ll explain they have different colors but look
just alike except for that. We&#8217;ll go to different
houses, the way Mr. Hambert does, and let folks
order a kitten. Then we can take it to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hambert has samples!&#8221; cried Dot, beginning
to understand. &#8220;Easter he has a nest
and Christmas he has spun sugar Santa Clauses&ndash;&ndash;and
he only takes one. We can do it, can&#8217;t we,
Twaddles?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I just say we could?&#8221; demanded
Twaddles. &#8220;Which one is the best sample?&#8221;</p>
<p>They hastily upset the box and the kittens
rolled out on the floor. Dot wanted to take a
black one and Twaddles leaned toward the yellow
one, so, not without some argument, they
finally compromised on the &#8220;tiger&#8221; kitten.</p>
<p>Mother Blossom and Aunt Polly were busy
in the house, and when Twaddles and Dot came
in to get their hats and coats and explained they
thought they could find a home for a kitten, no
one objected to their going out. They could go
anywhere in Oak Hill with perfect safety and
they knew just about every one in the town.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t say anything about finding homes
for all of the kittens,&#8221; said Twaddles as he
stuffed the &#8220;sample&#8221; inside his coat, &#8220;because if
we can&#8217;t get folks to take them, Bobby and Meg
will laugh. Where&#8217;ll we go first, Dot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The grocery store,&#8221; said Dot, who couldn&#8217;t
get Mr. Hambert and his methods of doing
business out of her mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grocery stores don&#8217;t want cats,&#8221; Twaddles
argued. Nevertheless he turned up the street
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
that would lead him to the main store in Oak
Hill, where kind Mr. Hambert was a clerk when
he wasn&#8217;t out delivering orders in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;They do, too,&#8221; shot back Dot. &#8220;They need
cats to keep the mice away&ndash;&ndash;Meg said so once.
Anyway, we can ask &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were a number of people in the store
lined up before the counter and the twins had
to await their turn. They were so interested in
watching one of the clerks slice ham with a
machine, that when Mr. Hambert came up to
them, smiling, and asked what he could do for
them, they jumped.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to buy anything,&#8221; said Twaddles
hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you must be selling something,&#8221; Mr.
Hambert laughed good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;but we came to see if you didn&#8217;t want a
cat,&#8221; Twaddles announced a bit jerkily. &#8220;We&ndash;&ndash;we
brought you a sample!&#8221; and he pulled the
little kitten from his coat and held it out to the
astonished grocery clerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; said Mr. Hambert &#8220;Are
you selling cats?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not selling them,&#8221; Twaddles insisted.
&#8220;We&#8217;re getting homes for them. This is a
sample.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Hambert began to laugh and so did
several of the customers who had been listening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, now, Hambert, you do need a cat,&#8221;
said the man who was waiting for the sliced
ham. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you tell me last week your old
Minnie died? Now here&#8217;s her successor. All
ready delivered at your door and no trouble for
you at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t take cats,&#8221; Mr. Hambert retorted.
&#8220;Tell you what you do, Twaddles, go into the
office and see what Mr. Morris has to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Morris was the owner of the store and he
had a desk in a small private office far back
from the counters. Twaddles marched down the
aisle and Dot after him. They found Mr. Morris
reading a newspaper and looking as though
he might not be very busy. He smiled when he
saw them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he said, &#8220;what brings you calling?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want a nice kitten, Mr. Morris?&#8221;
asked Twaddles persuasively. &#8220;It will grow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
up and catch mice and rats, and it won&#8217;t need
much to eat. If Minnie is dead, you really need
a cat, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it took several minutes to make the
grocery man understand what they were trying
to do, and then he laughed and they had to wait
till he wiped his eyes and could speak plainly.
But, after all this, Mr. Morris said he would be
very glad to take the kitten and it could live in
the store and would be sure of a comfortable
home.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we can&#8217;t leave this one&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s a sample,&#8221;
Dot explained earnestly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll bring you your
kitten this afternoon&ndash;&ndash;it will be just like this
one, only a different color.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure it will be as good a mouser and
as sweet-tempered and as pretty?&#8221; demanded
Mr. Morris. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to be disappointed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The twins assured him that all the kittens were
lovely and that gave him another thought. He
wanted to know how many there were.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven,&#8221; said Twaddles, &#8220;and Mother said
seven are too many to keep.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with your mother,&#8221; Mr. Morris said.
&#8220;And I believe, if you go to see my sister, Mrs.
Tracy, that she will be glad to take a kitten;
she&#8217;s expecting her little grandson to come for a
visit next week and she would be glad to have
a pet ready for him. You know where Mrs.
Tracy lives, don&#8217;t you? Over on Hammond
Square?&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles and Dot knew, and they hurried
over to Hammond Square eagerly. Sure enough,
Mrs. Tracy was glad to have a kitten, and like
her brother, she wanted to keep the &#8220;sample.&#8221;
But when matters were explained to her and she
understood that she could have her kitten that
afternoon, she was quite satisfied.</p>
<p>&#8220;That makes two,&#8221; said Dot, as they went
down the steps.</p>
<p>Finding homes for the five other kittens wasn&#8217;t
so easy. The twins went to every house where
they knew any one and some of these people
already had cats and others didn&#8217;t want any
cats. But they listened politely, though they
always laughed, and some of them told the twins
of friends who might be glad to have a kitten.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>The poor little &#8220;sample&#8221; was growing quite
rough looking and frowsy, from being pulled in
and out of Twaddles&#8217; coat so many times, and it
was almost noon when they had disposed of all
but one cat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go ask Miss Alder,&#8221; suggested Dot as
they passed a handsome house set in a circle of
evergreen trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll chase us,&#8221; Twaddles argued. &#8220;She
can&#8217;t stand children&ndash;&ndash;they make her nervous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot had heard this, too&ndash;&ndash;Miss Alder was a
wealthy and elderly woman who lived alone except
for two maids. She didn&#8217;t have much to do
with her neighbors and she had nothing at all
to do with the children in Oak Hill. She didn&#8217;t
like them and most of them were afraid of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t come, if you don&#8217;t want to, but
I&#8217;m going to ask her,&#8221; said Dot, turning in at
the path which led to the white doorway of
the Alder house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll come&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll need to show her
the sample,&#8221; Twaddles murmured, wondering
what made his knees feel so queer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>MISS ALDER&#8217;S HOUSE</h3>
</div>
<p>Dot rang the bell and waited quietly, but
Twaddles kept hopping up and down
the steps. He was down, when the door opened
suddenly and he was so afraid Dot would go in
and leave him outside that he rushed up the
steps, two at a time, and the maid nearly shut
the door in his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away, boy!&#8221; she said distinctly. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t allow boys around here.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was discouraging, but Dot refused to be
dismayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a girl,&#8221; she stated firmly. &#8220;Could I see
Miss Alder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll ask,&#8221; the maid answered. &#8220;Wait
a minute.&#8221; And she closed the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother says it is very rude to keep any one
waiting at the door,&#8221; whispered Dot. &#8220;She
always asks &#8217;em in.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can come in,&#8221; the maid announced,
opening the door before Twaddles could answer
Dot. &#8220;But the boy will have to wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has to come, too&ndash;&ndash;he has the sample,&#8221;
said Dot, who had no intention of going into a
strange house alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you selling something?&#8221; the maid demanded.
&#8220;It won&#8217;t do you any good to see Miss
Alder if you&#8217;re selling something; she won&#8217;t look
at samples.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake, Agnes, are you going to
stand there at the door all day?&#8221; said some one.
&#8220;Either come in and close the door or go outside
and finish your conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot glanced up and saw a face peering over
the maid&#8217;s shoulder. She saw dark eyes and
white hair and a rather grim mouth. But Dot
smiled her friendly little smile and spoke
clearly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Miss Alder?&#8221; she said, as
composedly as Meg would have said it. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you want a little kitten? We&#8217;re trying to find
homes for them and we have&ndash;&ndash;all but one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Miss Alder liked cats and she found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
herself liking Dot. But she couldn&#8217;t unbend all
at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure your feet are clean?&#8221; she asked
crisply. &#8220;Well, then, come in, both of you. I
can&#8217;t stand all this cold air. Come into the
sitting room and tell me what you call it you are
doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles and Dot followed her into a
pleasant sunny room, with a fireplace in which
a fire was merrily blazing. Miss Alder&#8217;s chair
was by the window and she pointed to a sofa
nearby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down there and keep your feet on that
rug,&#8221; she directed the twins. &#8220;If there is one
thing I cannot stand it is to have my floors
tracked up. Now what were you trying to tell
me about a kitten?&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles pulled the little tiger kitten out of
his coat and held it toward her.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the sample,&#8221; he said gravely. &#8220;We
had seven of them&ndash;&ndash;Meg and Bobby brought
them home, because Mr. Fritz was going to have
them drowned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve been going around, trying to get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
homes for them?&#8221; said Miss Alder approvingly.
&#8220;Why, I think that is very kind of you. Could
you find people who would give them homes?&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles told her where they had been and
what the people had said, and all the time he
talked Miss Adler was stroking the kitten which
she had taken on her lap. She asked a great
many questions and she did not laugh at all.
She was most serious, and when she had heard
the whole story, she said that she thought they
were just as good as they could be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most children wouldn&#8217;t go to so much
trouble,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Why, you are friends worth
having&ndash;&ndash;and I should like a kitten very much
indeed. Why don&#8217;t you let me keep this one?&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles looked uncertainly at Dot.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the sample,&#8221; he said uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean it <i>was</i> the sample,&#8221; Miss Alder
corrected. &#8220;If you have six kittens promised,
you don&#8217;t need any more samples; and if you
leave this one here with me, why, that will be
one delivered and will save you that much extra
trouble. Besides, I particularly like tiger cats.&#8221;</p>
<p>The twins saw how sensible this was, and they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
agreed to leave the kitten. Then Miss Alder
showed them her pets&ndash;&ndash;she had canaries and
goldfish and a white poodle dog who seemed
to like the kitten very much, though it humped
up its back and spit at him and would have
nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be friends in less than a week,&#8221; Miss
Alder declared comfortably.</p>
<p>The noon whistle reminded Dot and Twaddles
that they would be late for lunch and they
hurried off, but not before Miss Alder had
asked them to come and see her again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll want to see how the kitten grows,&#8221;
she told them.</p>
<p>Meg and Bobby were home from school before
the twins arrived and the family were just
sitting down to lunch. They had explained to
their mother and their Aunt Polly that Miss
Mason had put off the practicing of the Thanksgiving
songs until the next day.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we ate the lunch that Norah put up for us
at recess, Mother; and we can eat the regular
lunch now,&#8221; said Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;The kittens are one short,&#8221; said Bobby as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
soon as the twins came in sight. &#8220;Meg and I
went out and counted them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you children been all the morning?&#8221;
Mother Blossom asked Dot and Twaddles.
&#8220;You look excited, too. Is anything the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>The twins were bursting with news&ndash;&ndash;any one
could see that.</p>
<p>&#8220;All you have to do, Meg,&#8221; Twaddles informed
her casually, &#8220;is to deliver the kittens;
we have it all fixed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Deliver them? Deliver them where?&#8221; said
Meg, staring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, around,&#8221; Twaddles returned airily.
&#8220;Dot and I have been out and found homes for
them all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the whole seven?&#8221; said Bobby, staring
in turn. &#8220;Seven homes, Twaddles? Who wants
seven kittens?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom looked at Aunt Polly and
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you wonder Daddy says he doesn&#8217;t know
what to expect when he comes home at night?&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Twaddles and Dot, will you please
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
stop talking in riddles and tell us where you
have been and what you have done?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, the twins began to talk at
once, and though it was difficult to understand
them the family finally managed to learn what
they had done.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness, I call that a good morning&#8217;s
work,&#8221; said Aunt Polly at last. &#8220;To find places
for seven kittens! Why, Dot and Twaddles,
there isn&#8217;t anything you can&#8217;t do, if you stick to
a plan as you have to this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But one kitten is lost,&#8221; Meg pointed out.
&#8220;There are only six left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the sample,&#8221; said Twaddles calmly.
&#8220;We left it at Miss Alder&#8217;s house, because she
likes tiger cats.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then Bobby and Meg were surprised
again, to hear that the twins had been to Miss
Alder&#8217;s house, and they had to hear what had
happened there and what she had said to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you help us take them around this
afternoon?&#8221; asked Dot. &#8220;We can do it faster
if we all go; they are so squirmy to carry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course Bobby and Meg promised to help
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
deliver the cats and they hurried home from
school to keep their promise. As the houses
where the kittens were to go were pretty well
scattered&ndash;&ndash;the twins had worked hard and they
had covered most of Oak Hill that morning&ndash;&ndash;it
was decided that Dot and Twaddles should take
three of the kittens and Meg and Bobby the
other three. The twins were to go to the grocery
store and two houses near there, including Mrs.
Tracy&#8217;s, while Meg and Bobby would deliver
the cats at the other end of the town.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never know what those children are
going to do,&#8221; said Meg as she and Bobby
walked down Spruce Avenue, &#8220;but I am awfully
glad they found homes for the kittens; Mr.
Fritz will be glad, too. I don&#8217;t believe he wanted
them drowned, but he didn&#8217;t know what to do
with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby nodded absently. He was watching
some one further up the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;That looks like Charlie Black,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want to pass him when we&#8217;re carrying these
kittens&ndash;&ndash;he might try to start an argument and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
hurt them; let&#8217;s go down this next street and
cut around the block.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg was willing, for she knew that Charlie
Black&ndash;&ndash;who was on his roller skates again, might
try to snatch a kitten, and would certainly do his
best to torment them in some way.</p>
<p>The people who had promised the cats a home
were very glad to see the kittens, and Meg and
Bobby felt glad to think that the little creatures
would be sure of care and attention. Meg was
planning to tell Annabel Lee all about it that
night, when around the corner came Charlie
Black and almost skated into them before he
saw them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You take the kitten, Meg,&#8221; said Bobby hurriedly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was only one kitten left and Meg ran
across the street with it and up the steps of Mrs.
Anderson&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>She had to wait a few minutes for some one to
answer the doorbell and a few minutes longer
were required to explain to Mrs. Anderson&#8217;s
sister, who had not been at home that morning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
when the twins called, and then Meg ran back
to rejoin Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing, peddling cats?&#8221; asked
Charlie disagreeably.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not drowning them,&#8221; Bobby replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think you&#8217;re smart, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; said Charlie.
&#8220;Well, Bobby Blossom, you&#8217;re not so smart as
you seem to think&ndash;&ndash;catch me, if you can,&#8221; and
he made a dive at the little basket in which Meg
had carried the kittens.</p>
<p>He twisted it from her hands and shot off
down the street, Bobby after him. But Charlie
had a good start and as the pavement was cement
and exceptionally smooth, he seemed to be having
things his own way for the first two blocks.
Then he turned his head to see how close Bobby
was and an ash box tripped him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away!&#8221; he whined as Bobby caught up
with him, Meg following closely on his heels.
&#8220;Go away&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t you dare touch me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby leaned over him and took the basket,
handing it to Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;You get up and let me punch you!&#8221; he said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
hotly, but Charlie was in no haste to get to his
feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me alone,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You let me alone
and I&#8217;ll tell you something, Bobby! Honest I
will. I&#8217;ll tell you who spilled the ink on Miss
Mason&#8217;s book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg heard and almost dropped her basket.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>TIM ROON IS FOUND OUT</h3>
</div>
<p>Bobby continued to stand over Charlie
Black, ready to pounce on him should he
try to jump and run.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest, Bobby,&#8221; Charlie whined again. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
tell you who spoiled the book.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, who did?&#8221; demanded Bobby gruffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t hit me? Promise,&#8221; said Charlie,
very much frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I won&#8217;t hit you,&#8221; promised Bobby.
&#8220;Who did it? You?&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie Black scrambled to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get killed if I&#8217;m found out,&#8221; he declared,
&#8220;but Tim Roon did it, Bobby. I saw him. He
spilled ink all over it, &#8217;cause he was sore at Miss
Mason. An&#8217; he wouldn&#8217;t let me tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby and Meg were so excited that they
hardly knew when Charlie Black skated away,
after insisting that Tim Roon would certainly
murder him if he ever discovered that he had
told the secret.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tell? Of course we&#8217;ll tell everybody,&#8221; said
Meg, dancing along beside Bobby, who had
taken the box from her again. &#8220;Oh, hurry up,
Bobby. You&#8217;re so slow, and we must let Mother
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>At home the news was received with great rejoicing,
and the twins had to relieve their feelings
by banging on the dining-room gong till
Norah descended on them and confiscated the
padded stick. But Bobby was rather sober
through all the noise, and presently Mother
Blossom perceived this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to tell,&#8221; said Bobby,
when she questioned him. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get Tim Roon
into trouble, and Charlie Black, too. Course
I&#8217;d like Miss Mason to know I didn&#8217;t do it, but
I hate to make such a fuss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he silly, Mother?&#8221; demanded Meg. &#8220;If
you don&#8217;t tell, Bobby Blossom, I&#8217;m going to
school before you&#8217;re up and tell every one I
meet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Meg!&#8221; remonstrated Mother Blossom.
&#8220;This is Bobby&#8217;s affair, remember. But, Son,
you shouldn&#8217;t feel as you do. Every one who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
heard that you were accused of spoiling the book
has a right to know that you have been absolved.
I will write Miss Mason a note and explain it
fully, and then Tim and Charlie will have to
take the consequences. Any boy that will stand
aside and let another be unjustly accused deserves
whatever he gets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom&#8217;s cheeks were quite pink and
her blue eyes had little sparks in them, just as
Bobby&#8217;s did sometimes when he was angry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother is right,&#8221; declared Father Blossom,
who had come home early and had heard the
story from Aunt Polly, Meg, the twins, and
Norah before he had taken off his overcoat.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t fret about Tim and Charlie&ndash;&ndash;those young
scamps need a couple of interviews with Mr.
Carter if they are not to grow up utterly reckless.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the next morning Bobby carried a note to
Miss Mason, and when she had read it she
actually hugged him and begged his pardon as
simply as if he had been a grown-up friend.
She wanted to tell the whole class how mistaken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
she had been, but Bobby nearly fainted at the
thought and begged her not to.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell them one by one, then,&#8221; announced
Miss Mason, who, it seemed, could not do
enough to make up for her unkindness.</p>
<p>Before the morning session was called nearly
every child in the room knew that Bobby Blossom
had not touched Miss Mason&#8217;s book but
that Tim Roon was the culprit. Tim and
Charlie had been sent down to the principal&#8217;s
office by Miss Mason before assembly, and Miss
Wright had telephoned for Mr. Carter. He
came over at once, and Tim and Charlie spent
an unhappy hour with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re both cowards,&#8221; he told them hotly.
&#8220;I&#8217;d have you up before the class to confess your
underhanded scheme if I didn&#8217;t know that it
would embarrass Bobby more than it would you.
The school law won&#8217;t let me keep you longer
than an hour at night, but every night for a
month you&#8217;ll stay an hour after school. And,
Tim, here&#8217;s a note for your father. Don&#8217;t try
to get out of delivering it. I&#8217;ll call him up at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
six o&#8217;clock to-night and ask if he has received
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim gave his father the note that night, and
something very serious happened to him. More
than that, he had to work every Saturday for a
long, long time in his father&#8217;s store to help pay
the money his father insisted on sending to Miss
Mason. Of course it was impossible to replace
the book, for the autographs could never be collected
again, but Mr. Roon was determined to
pay Miss Mason the sum her friend had spent
for the book. It was a great deal of money,
but &#8220;the Roons always pay up,&#8221; declared Mr.
Roon, &#8220;and if it takes Tim the rest of his lazy
life, he&#8217;s got to work out the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon every one but Tim forgot the book, for
the Thanksgiving Day exercises were drawing
nearer and nearer. The Blossoms always had
wonderful times Thanksgivings, and this year,
with Aunt Polly with them, they meant to have
the best holiday yet.</p>
<p>Such boxes and barrels as came down from
Brookside Farm, packed by Jud and his father,
and reminding the four little Blossoms of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
good times they had had that summer. There
were red apples and green apples, yellow pumpkins,
potatoes, turnips and beautiful crisp celery,
black walnuts and butternuts, wonderful for cake
and candy and what Dot called &#8220;plain eating,&#8221;
and, most wonderful of all, two great plump
turkeys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are some you saw running around,
Twaddles,&#8221; Aunt Polly told him as he helped
her unpack the box. &#8220;Remember how they
looked? You thought they were chickens.&#8221;</p>
<p>The morning before Thanksgiving Day fresh
eggs and butter came by parcels post.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d only sent a tablecloth and a few
forks, Polly,&#8221; laughed Mother Blossom, &#8220;I
shouldn&#8217;t have had a thing to do about getting
dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg and Bobby couldn&#8217;t think much about
the dinner. Wasn&#8217;t this the day they were to
recite?</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be too awful,&#8221; said Meg, at the
breakfast table, &#8220;if when I got up on the platform
I should forget every word?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you won&#8217;t,&#8221; Mother Blossom assured her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
&#8220;You&#8217;ll remember every word. See if you don&#8217;t.
You come home to lunch, don&#8217;t you, children,
and get dressed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And then we have to be back by half-past
one,&#8221; said Bobby importantly. &#8220;The exercises
begin at two. Where&#8217;s my bag of apples?&#8221;</p>
<p>The children of the Oak Hill school every
year brought gifts of food to the Thanksgiving
Day exercises which were afterward distributed
among the poor families of the town. Bobby
took apples this year and Meg was to take two
jars of home-made preserves.</p>
<p>They hurried through the morning at school,
rushed home and found a devoted family on
hand to help them dress.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were such lots of things brought,&#8221;
chattered Meg, as her mother buttoned her into
the new white frock and Aunt Polly tied her
hair-ribbon. &#8220;They liked your potatoes, Dot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And my popcorn?&#8221; asked Twaddles anxiously.</p>
<p>The twins, not to be cheated out of the fun,
had insisted on sending Thanksgiving gifts, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they thought that was great,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
Bobby, shining and neat in his new suit. &#8220;Hurry,
Meg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come early and get good seats,&#8221; called Meg
as they trotted off.</p>
<p>At exactly two o&#8217;clock the whole school
marched into the assembly room and took the
seats reserved for them. The first and second
grades were seated on the platform, because experience
had taught the teachers that some of
the younger children invariably fell either up
or down the platform steps if they had anything
at all to do with them. On one side of the platform
the school committee sat, headed by Rufus
Hornbeck.</p>
<p>Bobby&#8217;s recitation followed the first song, and
he and the five boys with him breathed a great
sigh of relief when they were through and went
back to their seats free to enjoy the rest of the
afternoon.</p>
<p>Then came more songs and more recitations,
and then finally it was Meg&#8217;s turn. She had discovered
where her father and mother and Aunt
Polly and the twins were sitting, and when she
came out to speak she looked straight at them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
and smiled. And the five verses were as straight
and clear in her mind as though she were reciting
them to Mother Blossom in the sitting room
at home.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a dear little girl, and what a pretty
dress!&#8221; said an old lady sitting back of the Blossoms,
as Meg made her little bow at the end and
the room broke into hearty applause.</p>
<p>Twaddles turned around to beam approvingly
at the old lady.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my sister,&#8221; he informed her.</p>
<p>Rufus Hornbeck and two others of the committee
had to make rather long, tiresome
speeches, and when that was over the audience
joined in singing &#8220;My Country, &#8217;tis of thee,&#8221;
and the exercises were over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, look!&#8221; exclaimed Bobby, as they opened
the school door and stepped out into the street.</p>
<p>It was almost dark, for the days were fast
shortening, and a fine, light snow was falling
softly. Already the ground and walks were
white, and the fences were taking queer shapes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snow!&#8221; chorused the four little Blossoms in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
ecstasy. &#8220;Let&#8217;s ask Sam to mend the sleds to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The snow fell all that night and all the next
day and people said it was an old-fashioned
white Thanksgiving. An old-fashioned white
winter it proved to be, too, and if you want to
hear what fun the four little Blossoms had playing
in the white snow, you will have to read the
next book about them, called &#8220;Four Little Blossoms
and Their Winter Fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we only had new sleds,&#8221; sighed Bobby.
The sleds they had were somewhat old and
broken.</p>
<p>&#8220;We might get new ones,&#8221; said Meg hopefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to learn to skate this winter,&#8221; remarked
Twaddles.</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; added his twin.</p>
<p>And here, for a time, we will leave the four
little Blossoms and say good-by.</p>
